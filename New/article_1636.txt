Two U.S. Army service members were killed and a third wounded during a late-night operation in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said Thursday, following the death of an American soldier there this month.

The U.S. military has escalated its engagement in the country since the Trump administration took office in January, increasing airstrikes against the Taliban and Islamic State and more frequently sending out soldiers on operations with their Afghan counterparts.

An official with the international military coalition in the country said the soldiers were Army Rangers. The two were killed during an operation against ISIS Khorasan, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, referring to Islamic State's affiliate in the country.

The latest deaths come as the White House debates the military's request for more troops to fight resurgent Taliban and Islamic State threats in Afghanistan.
