WASHINGTON -- Donald J. Trump had a blunt warning for his predecessor.

''We should stay the hell out of Syria,'' he wrote on Twitter in June 2013, after President Barack Obama directed American forces to increase support to Syrian rebels in the wake of a deadly chemical weapons attack by that country's government.

We should stay the hell out of Syria, the "rebels" are just as bad as the current regime. WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS?ZERO -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2013

Nearly four years later, now president himself and grappling with how to respond to another chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, Mr. Trump ignored his own warnings and did what Mr. Obama threatened but never carried out: order a missile strike targeting assets of President Bashar al-Assad.

To understand the magnitude of Mr. Trump's reversal and the history of his public stances on one of the world's bloodiest civil wars, one need look no further than the president's Twitter account.

Mr. Trump posted dozens of tweets about the conflict in the years before he declared his candidacy for the White House, and frequently did so during the campaign as well. Channeling the same bluntness that helped fuel his political rise, he carved out a staunchly noninterventionist stance on the conflict and criticized as plodding Mr. Obama's approach.

But he also made one thing clear: If he was in charge, any action would be swift and secretive to catch Mr. Assad off guard.

We have sifted through Mr. Trump's account for the highlights:

2011-2012: Syria enters his radar screen

It was several months after it began before the growing conflict in Syria appears to have attracted Mr. Trump's attention, and, even then, it was only a blip. Mr. Trump, at the time best known as a reality television personality, first weighed in on Syria in October 2011 to criticize the United Nations for its inaction after China and Russia had successfully blocked sanctions against the Assad government.

Why is the UN condemning @Israel and doing nothing about Syria? What a disgrace. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2011

Nearly a year later, in the summer of 2012, Mr. Trump wrote again, this time aiming his criticism squarely at Mr. Obama for letting Russia begin to gain a foothold in the country -- a mistake he said Mr. Obama's Republican challenger at the time, Mitt Romney, would not have made.

Russia's recent actions in Syria have proven @MittRomney right. @BarackObama offers Putin "flexibility." @MittRomney will exert influence. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2012

August 2013: A chemical attack and warning on airstrikes

Late the next summer, as evidence began to emerge of a deadly chemical weapons attack on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus, the country's capital, the Obama administration began to debate military retaliation. And Mr. Trump unleashed a torrent of criticism.

In dozens of tweets, he warned Mr. Obama to ''stay out'' of Syria and focus on problems at home. Intervention, he said, would only risk hurting civilians and empowering would-be terrorists.

Remember, all these 'freedom fighters' in Syria want to fly planes into our buildings. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2013

Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack? -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013

If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2013

Despite his opposition to intervention, Mr. Trump repeatedly urged Mr. Obama to seek congressional approval to carry out punitive strikes against the Assad regime, warning that Mr. Obama would be making a ''big mistake'' if he failed to do so.

What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013

The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2013

August 2013: 'SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER'

At the same time he was tweeting his thoughts on how Washington should handle the crisis, Mr. Trump maintained the effort had already been sabotaged by too much ''talk.''

If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013

We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2013

Mr. Trump said he would have done things differently had he been in charge. It was an argument he would later repeat as a candidate, and as president.

@walaa_3ssaf No, dopey, I would not go into Syria, but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013

September 2013: Debating Obama's 'Red Line'

The debate over intervention centered in large part around a statement Mr. Obama made in 2012. The use of chemical weapons by Mr. Assad, he said, would cross a ''red line'' that would change the president's calculus and have ''enormous consequences'' for the Syrian government.

As he would do frequently during his campaign for president two years later, Mr. Trump used Twitter to repeatedly ridicule Mr. Obama's line as ''very dumb.''

President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE. Amazingly, now he denies he said that! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013

The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013

Facing stiff opposition in Congress, Mr. Obama unexpectedly said he would hold off on military action to instead pursue an international agreement to destroy Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons. Mr. Trump dismissed the proposal as a ''red line 2,'' and said it strengthened Mr. Assad.

Now Obama has set red line 2 with demand that Assad hands over Syria's chemical weapons or it will face an attack. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2013

Bashar Assad is stronger today than he was before Obama threatened military action. Obama really bungled this. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2013

2015-2016: A growing refugee crisis

As the conflict receded from the public spotlight, Mr. Trump turned to other subjects. Aside from a couple of stray mentions of the country in connection with the allied campaign against the Islamic State, Mr. Trump did not take it up again until late 2015 -- after he had become a Republican candidate for president.

He again warned about getting involved with Syria, and also cast suspicion upon refugees, whose flight out of the war-torn nation had prompted an international crisis.

Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane? -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2015

Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2016

Campaign 2016: Pinning Syria's woes on Clinton

Mr. Trump reiterated many of his older positions in the run-up to last fall's election. This time, he focused on tying American policy -- which he termed a disaster created by Mr. Obama -- to Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and his Democratic opponent.
