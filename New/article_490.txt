Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. Frictions between American intelligence agencies and the incoming administration are worsening.

At a Senate committee hearing, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., above, criticized the “isparagement” of the intelligence community over its findings that Russia interfered in the presidential election. Bolstered by the support of senators from both parties, he will brief President-elect Donald J. Trump himself Friday.

Mr. Trump took on Democrats and the health care law in a new Twitter blitz, calling Senator Chuck Schumer the Democrats’“ead clown.”

2. The videotaped beating of a white teenager with mental disabilities went viral, prompting nationwide outrage —nd hate crimes charges.

Four young African-Americans were charged. The 30-minute video appeared to show a Facebook livestream of the assault, which was laced with racial insults and included derisive statements about Mr. Trump.

3. When the marching band at a Alabama’ Talladega College got an invitation to play at Mr. Trump’ inauguration, some alumni of the historically black college were outraged.

But others saw it an opportunity for the tiny college’ students, some of whom had never visited the capital before.

The college president has now affirmed that the band will perform, saying, “e feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power.”

4. Peanuts are back on the kids’enu.

In a significant reversal from past advice, new national health guidelines call for parents to give their children foods containing peanuts early and often, starting in infancy.

Health experts say it will help children avoid life-threatening peanut allergies, which few ever outgrow.

5. Charles F. Feeney is a remarkably low-key billionaire.

An early and shrewd investor in tech start-ups, he transferred his fortune to an outfit called Atlantic Philanthropies in 1984, and has since given almost all $8 billion of it away —ostly in total secrecy.

He and his wife, Helga, now live in a rented apartment in San Francisco. “ou can only wear one pair of pants at a time,”e has said.

5. Some young Japanese men are bending fashion gender norms with hair dye, bright lipstick and heels. They say they’e not trying to dress like women, but that the concept of gender is simply irrelevant to their style choices.

“t’ not as if men have to do one thing, and women have to do another,”ne said. “ don’ find that very interesting. We’e all human beings.”

6. Can a satire of ISIS possibly be funny?

That’ the question in Britain, where a sketch called “he Real Housewives of \b ISIS\b0 ”ebuted on a satire show and attracted millions of views on social media.

Viewers were split over whether a dark sendup of one of the world’ most fearsome terrorist networks was appropriate, much less laugh-inducing.

7. Among our best-read articles today is an essay by a reporter in rural Iowa that seeks to explain why Mr. Trump won the rural vote.

His central insight is the philosophical difference between the two parties: Republicans believe people are fundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally good.

He argues that the divergence in foundational principles reinforced the rural-urban divides of history, economy and geography.

8. California winemakers are employing both high-tech and old-school techniques to adapt to hotter, drier conditions amid a yearslong drought.

As a result, the state’ wine country has become a laboratory for the reshaping of agriculture nationwide. Because, of course, it’ not just California that’ warming up.

9. New research concludes that a drop in violent crime in many cities is spurring gentrification.

Higher-income and college-educated movers appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups.

“hen cities feel safer, that opens people’ eyes,”ne of the researchers said.

_____

10. Finally, in case you’e looking for something to watch on Saturday night: The documentary “right Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds”will debut then on HBO, after the network moved up its premiere from March.

Our critic says it smartly, and subtly, pushes its audience to ask two of modern pop society’ central, uncomfortable questions: First, are famous people “eal”eople? And second, am I becoming my mother?
