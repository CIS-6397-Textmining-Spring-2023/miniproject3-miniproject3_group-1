VARIETY PUZZLE -- Sam Ezersky is quickly growing on me as a puzzle maker, and I'm not saying this just because he sits next to me at work and allows me free access to his candy stash. Every constructor leaves a stylistic fingerprint on their puzzles, and I like Mr. Ezersky's playful way with a clue.

This is evident in today's Puns and Anagrams, which is Mr. Ezersky's second to be published (his debut PandA is here.) Not only does Mr. Ezersky use a variety of cluing types, which one would expect in a PandA, but the topics he covers are fun: solvers will encounter board games (L SEVEN for ''Battleship''), animals at the zoo (OCELOTS), Egyptian goddesses (ISIS) and even made-up campaign slogans for rock stars (ELECTRIC).

I also like the fact that he is not afraid to get corny. At 52A, the clue ''Break __ (get d'party going)'' for DICE (or ''D ICE'') will elicit a grin.

And I admire some of his catches: If you move the ''S'' to the front of EXCHANGES (15D), you get SEX CHANGE. A ''Treatment in which beauticians dampen eyes'' is MANI PEDI because that word contains two eyes (I's) and an anagram of DAMPEN. That's very cool.

That will get you started, and I hope you'll give this one a try, if you haven't already. It's a fun diversion for your weekend.

Your thoughts?
