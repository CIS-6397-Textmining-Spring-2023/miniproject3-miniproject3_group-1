Affected institutions include two of China’ most prestigious universities and blue-chip companies in Japan like Hitachi and Nissan. Solving cybercrimes like the ransomware attack involves old-school sleuthing.

In Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the attacks seemed to be limited mostly to small businesses.

•he U.N. Security Councilunanimously condemned North Korea’ missile test on Sunday.

Pyongyang said the ballistic missile could carry a nuclear warhead, and warned the U.S. that its military bases in the Pacific were within its range.

Back Story

Put on your party hats: The world is celebrating a series of royal birthdays.

Last week, European royals gathered in Oslo to honor the 80th birthdays of King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway. (He actually hit the milestone in February; she will in July.)

A highlight was a cruise on the royal yacht, a fitting setting for the king, an admiral and accomplished sailor who represented Norway in three Olympics.

And King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia, above, turned 64 on Sunday. His background as a cultural ambassador and Unesco delegate may have also helped with his royal duties. He is also an accomplished classical dancer and studied filmmaking in North Korea.

A few days before, he presided over the nation’ Royal Plowing Ceremony, in which sacred oxen forecast the year’ crops. (It is predicted to be a good year for corn, beans and rice.)

Back in Europe, Queen Máima of the Netherlands celebrates a birthday on Wednesday.

And arguably the biggest royal birthday comes next month, when Queen Elizabeth II of Britain celebrates her 91st. She is the world’ oldest —nd longest-serving —onarch. Although she was born April 21, her birthday is officially celebrated in June each year.
