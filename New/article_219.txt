Back Story

On the lunar calendar, Saturday is the ninth day of the ninth month, and a traditional Chinese holiday: the Double Ninth Festival.

Also referred to as the Chongyang Festival, the celebration has roots that stretch back centuries.

One legend tells of a hero who defeated a disease-spreading river demon with the help of chrysanthemum wine and dogwood.

Mountain climbing, chrysanthemums and dogwood displays are still a tradition on the day, which has a focus on good health and longevity. In fact, China designated the date Seniors’ay in 1989. (Taiwan named it Senior Citizens’ay in 1966.)

Japan, which adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1872, honors the holiday on the ninth day of September, the ninth month.

A common link is the chrysanthemum, a flower native to China but that has long been celebrated in Japan. (The country’ royal family is metaphorically referred to as the Chrysanthemum Throne.)

A Times article in 1958 described a centuries-old festival dedicated to the flower: “he ancient court fete became the heritage of lords and nobles. Attired in gorgeous robes, and well provided with sake, they composed poems in honor of the chrysanthemums’eauty.”

Charles McDermid contributed reporting.
