Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. P resident Trump gave highly classified information on \b ISIS\b0  to Russia in an Oval Office meeting last week, breaking a deal with an ally, officials said.

He leaves Friday on his first overseas trip as president. The first stop is Saudi Arabia.

Syria is likely to be at the top of the agenda in his discussions. Also Monday, the State Department released new satellite images from Syria that officials said show a crematory used to hide mass executions at a government prison.

2. The Supreme Court will stay out of a fight over a restrictive North Carolina voter ID law.

That leaves in place a federal appeals court ruling that struck down parts of the law, enacted in 2013.

The lower court called the measure an unconstitutional effort to “arget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.”

Above, an N.A.A.C.P. meeting in Raleigh erupted in cheers when members learned of the news.

3. New digital clues point to North Korean-linked hackers as likely suspects in the sweeping ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems around the world, experts said.

The cyberattacks continued to ripple through politics and markets, especially in Asia.

China, which reported disruptions at nearly 40,000 organizations, was especially susceptible because of the prevalence of pirated software there.

Solving cybercrimes like the ransomware attacks involves old-school sleuthing. Our animated map shows how the attack spread. Here’ how to protect yourself.

4. Can you identify North Korea on a map?

A survey of 1,700 Americans found only 36 percent could do so. Those who could were more likely to favor diplomacy over military action.

Meanwhile, North Korea said that the ballistic missile it tested over the weekend could carry a nuclear warhead —nd warned that American military bases were within its range.

5. Young black leaders in the Democratic Party are pushing for a more aggressive stance toward President Trump as they eye the 2018 elections.

Many of the potential candidates are looking to shore up their support among minority communities and young voters.

That’ a break from the conventional Democratic strategy of trying to appeal to older white moderates in tough races.

“ Democrat wins an election in Georgia by speaking truth to power,”aid Representative Stacey Abrams, who is considering a run for governor.

_____

6. The 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan has endangered children in Cambodia.

The disaster set off an unexpected shortage of iodine, an element crucial to early brain growth.

Cambodia began iodizing table salt in 1999, with good results. But in 2011, the price of iodine skyrocketed.

Since then, iodine concentrations in Cambodian children have dropped by 30 percent, and doctors and aid agencies are rushing to prevent permanent damage.

_____

7. The New York Times documented every homicide last year in a patch of New York City where poverty and crime persist: the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx.

Today we published the final article in the series, about a gang-related shooting that detectives said stemmed from fighting among members of the Bloods.

It remains unsolved. Above, friends and relatives of the victim, Jequan Lawrence.

_____

8. We traveled to a mountaintop village in the Philippines to meet a tattoo artist with practically mythical status.

Maria Fang-od Oggay, above, thought to be 100 years old, uses the traditional tattooing methods of her ethnic group, the Kalinga.

An appearance in a 2009 documentary shot her to fame, and now she attracts clients from all over the world.

_____

9. U2 is touring to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its hit album “he Joshua Tree.”

Our critic was at the first U.S. show, in Seattle, above, and he says the pivotal album is worth revisiting. The songs “ondered 1980s America as both myth and presence,”ut “old eerie resonances”ith the present, he writes.

The band also played one new song, “he Little Things That Give You Away.”hey had been working on another album, but the presidential election sent them back to the studio for rewrites.

_____

10. Finally, President Trump kissed his chief spokesman, Sean Spicer.

Just kidding, that was “aturday Night Live.” Melissa McCarthy got rave reviews for her return as an angry, angst-ridden Mr. Spicer, riding a motorized podium all the way to Trump Tower.

Have a great night.
