And so it came to pass that in the winter of 2016 the world hit a tipping point that was revealed by the most unlikely collection of actors: , , , and the Macy’ department store. Who’ have thunk it?

And what was this tipping point?

It was the moment when we realized that a critical mass of our lives and work had shifted away from the terrestrial world to a realm known as “yberspace.”hat is to say, a critical mass of our interactions had moved to a realm where we’e all connected but no one’ in charge.

After all, there are no stoplights in cyberspace, no police officers walking the beat, no courts, no judges, no God who smites evil and rewards good, and certainly no “-800-Call-If-Putin-Hacks-Your-Election.”f someone slimes you on Twitter or , well, unless it is a death threat, good luck getting it removed, especially if it is done anonymously, which in cyberspace is quite common.

And yet this realm is where we now spend increasing hours of our day. Cyberspace is now where we do more of our shopping, more of our dating, more of our friendship-making and sustaining, more of our learning, more of our commerce, more of our teaching, more of our communicating, more of our news-broadcasting and news-seeking and more of our selling of goods, services and ideas.

It’ where both our president-elect and the leader of ISIS can communicate with equal ease with tens of millions of their respective followers through Twitter —ithout editors, fact-checkers, libel lawyers or other filters.

And, I would argue, 2016 will be remembered as the year when we fully grasped just how scary that can be —ow easy it was for a presidential candidate to tweet out untruths and half-truths faster than anyone could correct them, how cheap it was for Russia to intervene on Trump’ behalf with hacks of Democratic operatives’omputers and how unnerving it was to hear Yahoo’ chief information security officer, Bob Lord, say that his company still had “ot been able to identify”ow one billion Yahoo accounts and their sensitive user information were hacked in 2013.

Even President Obama was taken aback by the speed at which this tipping point tipped. “ think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking and so forth, to have an impact on our open societies,”e told ABC News’ “his Week.”

At Christmas, Amazon.com taught yet more traditional retailers how hard the cybertipping point has hit retailing. Last week, Macy’ said it was slashing 10,000 jobs and closing dozens of stores because, , “Macy’ hasn’ been able to solve consumers’hift to online shopping.”

At first Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, insisted that fake news stories carried by Facebook “urely had no impact”n the election and that saying so was “ pretty crazy idea.”ut in a very close election it was not crazy at all.

Facebook —hich wants all the readers and advertisers of the mainstream media but not to be saddled with its human editors and fact-checkers —s now taking more seriously its responsibilities as a news purveyor in cyberspace.

Alan S. Cohen, chief commercial officer of the cybersecurity firm Illumio (I am a small shareholder), noted in an that the reason this tipping point tipped now was because so many companies, governments, universities, political parties and individuals have concentrated a critical mass of their data in enterprise data centers and cloud computing environments.

Ten years ago, said Cohen, bad guys did not have the capabilities to get at all this data and extract it, but “ow they do,”nd as more creative tools like big data and artificial intelligence get “eaponized,”his will become an even bigger problem. It’ a huge legal, moral and strategic problem, and it will require, said Cohen, “ new social compact”o defuse.

Work on that compact has to start with every school teaching children digital civics. And that begins with teaching them that the internet is an open sewer of untreated, unfiltered information, where they need to bring skepticism and critical thinking to everything they read and basic civic decency to everything they write.

A published in November found “ dismaying inability by students to reason about information they see on the internet. Students, for example, had a hard time distinguishing advertisements from news articles or identifying where information came from. …ne assessment required middle schoolers to explain why they might not trust an article on financial planning that was written by a bank executive and sponsored by a bank. The researchers found that many students did not cite authorship or article sponsorship as key reasons for not believing the article.”

Prof. Sam Wineburg, the lead author of the report, said: “any people assume that because young people are fluent in social media they are equally perceptive about what they find there. Our work shows the opposite to be true.”

In an era when more and more of our lives have moved to this digital realm, that is downright scary.
