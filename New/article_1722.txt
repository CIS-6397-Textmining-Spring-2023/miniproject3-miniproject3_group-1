BELGIUM

Police Shoot Suspect

At Train Station

Belgian security forces shot and killed a man believed to have caused an explosion in Brussels' Central Station on Tuesday evening.

No other casualties were reported.

A spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said a small explosion went off in the station but the suspect was then "neutralized" by soldiers patrolling the area.

"The incident is being considered a terrorist attack," said the spokesman, Eric Van Der Sypt.

Belgium has been on terror alert level 3 for months following an attack in March 2016 at the national airport and a subway station in Brussels that killed 32 people. Its top terror alert level is 4.

PHILIPPINES

Militants Linked

To ISIS Attack Village

Militants aligned with Islamic State stormed a village and may have taken hostages in the southern Philippines early Wednesday, police and the military said, 50 miles south of where government forces have been waging an urban war against Islamic militants for more than a month.

Members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters group attacked a village near the town of Pigcawayan in central Mindanao island at dawn and held an unknown number of hostages, Chief Insp. Realan Mamon, police chief of Pigcawayan, said in a radio interview. He told the Associated Press that it wasn't clear whether militants had taken hostages or if people had been trapped in the fighting.

The gunmen targeted an army outpost and a patrol base of pro-government militiamen, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla told the Associated Press. He said the attack could be an effort by militants to divert the military's focus from fighting in Marawi.
