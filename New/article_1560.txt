IRAQ

U.S. Airstrike Killed

Civilians by Accident

A U.S. airstrike on a suspected Islamic State fighting position in Mosul in March unintentionally killed more than 100 civilians, most of whom died as a result of a secondary blast from munitions packed into a residential area by extremists, a military investigation released Thursday concluded.

The Defense Department said the March 17 airstrike targeted a pair of militant snipers, but triggered a follow-on explosion that collapsed part of a building, killed 101 civilians and left three dozen missing, according to results of the military investigation.

"The investigation determined that ISIS emplaced a large amount of explosive material in a structure containing a significant number of civilians and then attacked Iraqi forces from the structure," said a statement from the U.S.-led coalition taking part in the campaign to retake Mosul.
