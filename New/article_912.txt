•n Turkey, some opinion polls this week show a slim majority of voters favor expanding President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’ powers in Sunday’ referendum. To Mr. Erdogan, the answer to all the country’ economic, military and political challenges appears to be an expansion of his mandate.

We asked Turkish overseas voters how they felt about the proposed changes. Their responses varied, but tying them together was a deep sense of concern about the country’ future.

Meanwhile, life in the fragile democracy is becoming stranger, as a purge of people suspected of supporting a coup has turned Orwellian.

Back Story

Over a dinner of crayfish in Stockholm in 1924, two men decided that Sweden needed its own car manufacturer, one that made vehicles suitable for the harsh local climate and whose guiding principle was safety.

From their idea came Volvo — Latin translation of “ roll”—hich rolled its first car off the assembly line 90 years ago today. The car, an Ö 4, was affectionately called “akob.”

The Swedes were hardly the first to produce automobiles; people like Karl Benz and Henry Ford had already been at it for decades.

In 1999, Ford Motor bought Volvo, which was later sold in 2010 to Geely, a Chinese automaker, for $1.3 billion.

For the new owner, buying Volvo was momentous: “e are like a poor farm boy pursuing a famous movie star,”Li Shufu, Geely’ chairman, said.

By the end of next year, the company, which is still based in Sweden and owned by a Chinese conglomerate, says it will be producing up to 100,000 cars a year in South Carolina.

It’ a head-spinning tale of globalization that started over a humble meal almost a century ago.
