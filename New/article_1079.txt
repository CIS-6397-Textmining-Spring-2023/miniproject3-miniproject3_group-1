Back Story

Today is Bloomsday, a special day on the literary calendar.

James Joyce, the groundbreaking Irish novelist chose to immortalize June 16, 1904, in his novel “lysses”ecause it was the date of his first outing with his future wife, Nora Barnacle.

It is named after Leopold Bloom, whom the book follows on a daylong picaresque voyage through Dublin, Joyce’ hometown. More than a century later, the character’ “dyssey”s celebrated around the world with readings, re-enactments and, sometimes, heavy drinking.

“lysses”s no easy summer read. A review when it was published in 1922 compared the prose to the “roductions of the Ouija board.”

But help is a tap away.

There are now apps, including one that uses a touch screen to untangle tough sentences, plus an explanatory podcast. A group of Boston College students is developing a “lysses”ame, “oycestick.”

“f it’ so hard to read,”he illustrator Robert Berry once asked, “hy are people having so much fun with it?”

Have a great Bloomsday.
