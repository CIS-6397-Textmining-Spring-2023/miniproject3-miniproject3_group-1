WASHINGTONâ€”.S. airstrikes killed 17 Islamic State militants in Libya, the U.S. military said Sunday.              

The six "precision airstrikes," carried out on Friday, hit an Islamic State desert camp about 50 miles southeast of Sirte, the U.S. Africa Command said.              

The camp was used "by ISIS to move fighters in and out of the country; stockpile weapons and equipment; and to plot and conduct attacks," the U.S. Africa Command said.             

The strikes were carried out in conjunction with the Libyan military and aligned forces, the U.S. Africa Command said.
