Good morning on this wet Friday.

On President Trump’ first trip back to the city, hundreds of residents took to the streets to chide, deride or applaud their hometown president.

New Yorkers, it seems, have a lot to say about Mr. Trump’ first 100 days in office.

So we asked the protesters and supporters who had gathered outside the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid, where Mr. Trump spoke Thursday evening, to answer the following question with a Twitter-size response:

In President Trump’ next 100 days, what would you like to see him accomplish?

“ass affordable health care that takes care of the citizens of this country.”

—ennis Gagomiros, Hell’ Kitchen, 65, Democrat

“urn around his views on health care. Have some empathy, sympathy, and compassion for those who voted him in.”

—rundun Johnson, 71, Washington Heights, Democrat

“ake away money from New York City and put them on lockdown if they want to be a sanctuary city.”

—lisa Nahoum, 46, Bayside, Queens, Republican

“ hope he doesn’ accomplish anything because his agenda is horrific.”

—ete Sikora, 42, Carroll Gardens, Democrat

“umber 1: Tax Code. Lower on the poor, more on the rich.”

—sa Lowe, 45, Coney Island, Brooklyn, Republican

“ would like him to rescind every executive order he’ made. Resign.”

—isa Harrison, 60, Upper West Side, Democrat

“ want him to start an investigation into the deep state and clean it up.”

—ector Beguero, 58, Jackson Heights, Queens, Republican

“o not tweet. To form a mature adult sentence. And to go away.”

—anet Pytik, 50, Upper West Side, Democrat

“efeat ISIS. Build a Wall. Establish extreme vetting.”

—riel Kohane, 46, Upper West Side, Republican

“uclear Armageddon. Put us out of our misery.”

—on Kuby, 60, Chelsea, Democrat

What would you like to see Mr. Trump accomplish in his next 100 days in office? Let us know in the comments.

Here’ what else is happening:

Weather

Some people like watching the puddles gather rain.

If you’e one of them, you have three days of excitement ahead.

Today is likely to be the wettest, but expect the showers, fog, wind (and possible thunderstorms) to stick around for most of the weekend, with highs around 60.

Hair forecast: Sopping Shirley Temple.
