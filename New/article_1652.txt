HONOLULUâ€” federal grand jury in Hawaii indicted a U.S. soldier on Friday for attempting to provide material support to Islamic State.

Army Sgt. 1st Class Ikaika Kang was arrested by an FBI SWAT team on July 8. Sgt. Kang was ordered held without bail.

Sgt. Kang will be arraigned in federal court on Monday when he had previously been scheduled for a preliminary hearing. Sgt. Kang's court-appointed attorney, Birney Bervar, said his client will plead not guilty on Monday when a federal judge will set a trial date.

Sgt. Kang is charged with four counts of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group based on events that occurred in Hawaii between June 21 and July 8, prosecutors said.

Federal officials say Sgt. Kang met with undercover FBI agents he thought were with the terror group and provided classified military documents to the agents.

The FBI said in their criminal complaint that Sgt. Kang wanted to commit a mass shooting after pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group.

Sgt. Kang served in Iraq from March 2010 to February 2011, and in Afghanistan from July 2013 to April 2014, according to the complaint. He was most recently stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.
