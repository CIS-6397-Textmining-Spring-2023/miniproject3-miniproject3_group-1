Back Story

“e Beaujolais nouveau est arrivé”

Signs bearing these words appear today in restaurants and cafes across France and around the world, indicating that one of the year’ youngest wines is available on its traditional release day, the third Thursday of November.

The practice has a long history. “t’ a time when great gourmets stop drinking the grands crus and revel in the simplicity of a Beaujolais,”he writer and wine expert Frank Schoonmaker told The Times more than half a century ago.

To this day, the young wine’ release offers an excuse to gather with friends to opine on the year’ harvest and savor its fruitiness.

(If you have some spare time, do read this essay by Patricia Wells on the Beaujolais savored in Parisian wine bars in 1982.)

The Times first mentioned wine from the Beaujolais region in 1873. In 1955, we recommended it as “a good picnic companion.”

“he wines are as light on the wallet as they are in the glass,”ur critic, Howard Goldberg, wrote in 1987. “his frivolity makes them ideal quaffing wines for parties until New Year’ Eve, when Champagne takes over.

“esides, they are so short-lived they should be pretty much finished by then.”

Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.
