WASHINGTON -- A detailed map purportedly showing where U.S. forces are deployed in northern Syria was published by Turkey's state-run news agency, drawing a sharp retort and a warning from the Pentagon that the move could undermine the battle against Islamic State.

The U.S. government on Wednesday expressed its concerns to Turkish officials after Anadolu Agency released a lengthy article and a map it said showed the locations of 10 bases used by hundreds of U.S. forces in northern Syria battling Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

"The release of sensitive military information exposes coalition forces to unnecessary risk and has the potential to disrupt ongoing operations to defeat ISIS," the U.S. military said in a statement. "ISIS is the greatest threat to regional stability and it is critical that all parties operating in Syria remain focused on what is most important -- the annihilation of ISIS."

Release of the map angered some U.S. officials, who privately expressed frustration that Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, would threaten its relationship with Washington by allowing its state-run news agency to publish sensitive information.

"While we cannot independently verify the sources that contributed to this article, we would be very concerned if officials from a NATO ally would purposefully endanger our forces by releasing sensitive information," the Pentagon said. "We have conveyed these concerns to the government of Turkey."

Turkish officials didn't respond to requests to comment about the release of the information, which comes as the U.S. military is stepping up its efforts to push Islamic State out of Raqqa, its de facto capital in Syria.
