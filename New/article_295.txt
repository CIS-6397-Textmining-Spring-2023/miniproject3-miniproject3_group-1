Major news events in 2017 were big -- often big enough to be seen from far above.

Women's March: On Jan. 21, millions of people joined women's marches across the United States and the world. Here are some of the roughly 500,000 people who marched in Washington, D.C. (PHOTOGRAPH BY AIRLIVE); Lights Out in Puerto Rico: In September, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, leaving the island devastated and all but destroying its power grid. (PHOTOGRAPH BY NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION); Giant Algal Bloom: Lake Erie experienced one of the worst algal blooms in recent years, turning the lake bright green and alarming residents and local officials. At its peak, it stretched for miles south of Detroit, from Toledo to the shores of Ontario. (PHOTOGRAPH BY LANDSAT); ISIS Leaves Behind Ruined Cities: The Islamic State lost substantial territory in Iraq and Syria this year, including Raqqa, its de facto capital in Syria, and Mosul, its largest population center in Iraq. When the fighting subsided in these cities, entire neighborhoods had been leveled. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY DIGITALGLOBE); Wildfires Across the Globe: Massive wildfires spread across parts of Chile; Western Canada and the United States; Portugal and Spain; France and even Greenland in 2017. California's Thomas Fire, below, was the largest wildfire of the year in the state. Active fires are highlighted in red and orange, using infrared data collected by the satellite.
