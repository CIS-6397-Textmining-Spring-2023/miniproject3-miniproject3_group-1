WASHINGTON -- The return of Mosul to Iraqi control represents a significant symbolic and strategic victory over Islamic State, but the group remains active in parts of Iraq and Syria and is far from defeated, U.S. military commanders and other American officials said as officials in Iraq claimed victory in the battle.

President Donald Trump congratulated Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Iraq's security forces, along with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.

"The victory in Mosul, a city where ISIS once proclaimed its so-called 'caliphate,' signals that its days in Iraq and Syria are numbered," Mr. Trump said. "We will continue to seek the total destruction of ISIS," he said, using another name for the group.

"Mosul would have been a challenging fight for any army, and the coalition is proud to stand side by side with our Iraqi partners as they celebrate their hard-fought victory," said Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top U.S. commander in the region.

The fight against Islamic State isn't over, Gen. Townsend and other officials stressed. Gen. Townsend noted that while the victory in Mosul amounts to a "decisive blow," tough fighting remains.

"Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again," he said.
