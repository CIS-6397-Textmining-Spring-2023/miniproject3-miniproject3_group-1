The article began with a question I could not answer. I was in the midst of writing my first piece on the systematic enslavement of Yazidi women by the Islamic State, and I turned to the scholar Kecia Ali, who studies slavery in early Islam. Citing a ruling in Islamic jurisprudence that requires slave owners to observe a period of abstinence after purchasing a female slave to ensure that she is not carrying someone else's child, Ms. Ali asked me whether the ISIS fighters holding the Yazidi victims were checking for pregnancy.

The question pointed to a phenomenon I had documented but could not explain: Hundreds of women raped by ISIS had escaped by the time I began recording their stories in 2015. Yet almost none had become pregnant.
