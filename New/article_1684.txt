A U.S. soldier stationed in Hawaii has been charged with providing material support to ISIS, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in Honolulu.

Ikaika Kang, 34 years old, allegedly tried to support the terror group by passing along classified military documents to undercover FBI agents whom he believed would give them to ISIS. Mr. Kang is accused of making combat training videos to be used to train ISIS fighters. He also allegedly contributed to the purchase of a drone that he believed would be used by ISIS.

An attorney representing Mr. Kang didn't respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Kang came to the attention of investigators after an unnamed source reported that he was talking about ISIS, and "anti-government topics," according an affidavit filed with the complaint. The FBI launched an undercover investigation that culminated in his arrest Saturday by an FBI SWAT team.

The probe lasted more than a year, according to Paul Delacourt, special agent in charge of the FBI's Honolulu Division.

"FBI assets and Army investigative resources were continuously deployed to ensure the public's safety during the course of this investigation and Kang's eventual arrest," Mr. Delacourt said.

Mr. Kang served in Iraq from March 2010 to February 2011, and in Afghanistan from July 2013 to April 2014, according to the complaint. He was most recently stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.

A military spokesman didn't respond to requests seeking comment.
