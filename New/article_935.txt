In ''Band Aid,'' Anna (Zoe Lister-Jones of TV's ''Life in Pieces'') and her husband, Ben (Adam Pally), are in distress. Both are frustrated artists. She's a writer who drives for Uber; he's a graphic designer who has taken on corporate work. They feel increasing pressure to have a baby from friends and from Ben's mother, none of whom know about Anna's miscarriage. Their lives are consumed with petty squabbles.

''What if we turned all our fights into songs?'' Anna asks. And while the songs have adequate toe-tapping potential, they are primarily a storytelling device, a way of lending this couples-therapy comedy some distinction. (In addition to writing, directing and starring in the movie, Ms. Lister-Jones composed the music for the tunes, mostly with Kyle Forester, and wrote the lyrics.)

Both leads are excellent together, and the movie is good at showing how Anna and Ben push each other's buttons. (Ms. Lister-Jones also has strong instincts for how to frame their spats visually.) At other times, ''Band Aid'' feels overly tidy. Will Anna and Ben fix the dripping kitchen faucet -- metaphor! -- that's seen in the first shot?

Some of the bigger laughs come from the periphery (a friend has a daughter named Isis -- after the Egyptian goddess, of course). But the movie fires wide of the mark with Dave (Fred Armisen), the recovering sex addict and cocoa-fiend neighbor who becomes Anna and Ben's drummer. Over all, ''Band Aid'' is only sometimes as cutesy as its title.

Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.
