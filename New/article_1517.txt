WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will host Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi at the White House on April 3 to discuss the fight against Islamic State and regional peace and stability, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.

Mr. Sisi's visit is the first official meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump took office. They met during the campaign last fall and officials said earlier in March that they expected the Egyptian leader to visit.

"President Trump and President Al Sisi will use the visit to build on the positive momentum they have built for the United States-Egypt relationship," Mr. Spicer said. "They will discuss a range of bilateral and regional issues, including how to defeat ISIS and pursue peace and stability in the region. "

The meeting would come ahead of a summit between Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida, likely later in the week. A senior State Department official said Tuesday the meeting would be held late next week and that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will join Mr. Trump.
