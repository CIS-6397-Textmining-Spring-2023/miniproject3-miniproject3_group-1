A sword used in public executions, a ruined church and a child's backpack laden with explosives. These are some of the visible signs of the Islamic State's three-year rule over the Iraqi city of Mosul that Rukmini Callimachi, a New York Times correspondent, saw as she toured the ruins this week. The Iraqi military declared victory over the extremist group, but its legacy can still be seen on the damaged streets of the city.

Churches, like mosques, were crucial hideouts for Islamic State members. They assumed coalition forces would be reluctant to bomb such sites.; A backpack, decorated with a kitten, that contained sachets of white powder. Soldiers said it was C4, a plastic explosive.; Inside a school, the Islamic State, which rejects Western iconography, had blurred out the faces of Dora the Explorer and Donald Duck.; A sword found in the western part of the city. Iraqi soldiers said militants had used the weapon to behead people in public executions.; Iraq officially declared victory over the Islamic State in Mosul on Sunday, but a day later artillery could be heard in pockets of the city; Visiting journalists were allowed into the area only if they were traveling in Humvees. This is a view from inside one. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY RUKMINI CALLIMACHI)
