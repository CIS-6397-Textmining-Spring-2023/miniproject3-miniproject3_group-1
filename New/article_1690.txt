A train derailed at New York Penn Station Thursday night, just days before several tracks at the station are due to close for extensive repairs following two derailments earlier this year.

A spokeswoman for NJ Transit said a North Jersey Coast Line train carrying 180 passengers "experienced a minor derailment" as it approached Penn Station around 9 p.m.

A spokesman for the New York Fire Department said it had received a report that one car derailed. No injuries were reported, the spokesman said.

NJ Transit suspended service in and out of Penn Service.

NJ Transit's Midtown Direct trains were diverted to Hoboken. Rail passes and tickets were cross honored with PATH and on buses.

As she headed toward a nearby PATH station, Catherine Lisowski, a commuter from Union, N.J., said she had become accustomed to rail delays and problems. "I've just learned to go with it. Life could be worse. You could have this, or you could have ISIS."

Amtrak will close several tracks at Penn Station for eight weeks starting July 10 so that engineers can carry out extensive repairs to rails and switches at the western end of the station, which is used heavily by NJ Transit.

An NJ Transit train derailed at the station in April. In March, an Amtrak train derailed there.

Amtrak had instituted a temporary speed restriction at the station while engineers carried out track maintenance work and inspections in preparation for the repair work.

Amtrak lifted the speed restriction on Monday.
