BAGHDAD -- President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner made a surprise visit to Baghdad on Monday to meet U.S. and Iraqi officials and to receive military briefings on the fight against Islamic State.

Mr. Kushner is the first member of Mr. Trump's inner circle to visit Iraq, currently engaged in a fight to drive the militant group from Mosul and other areas. He was invited here by the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joe Dunford, who is meeting with U.S. and Iraqi commanders and troops.

The visit comes as the Trump administration is assessing the U.S. strategy to combat Islamic State in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.

Mr. Kushner, 36, a newcomer to foreign-policy issues, has taken an active role as an adviser to Mr. Trump on national security and foreign policy.

Last month, Mr. Kushner made, for a White House official, a rare appearance at the Pentagon, where he met Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman during his meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

He has also been influential with his father-in-law on issues pertaining to Mexico and other countries, and he has been given broad authority by his father-in-law to attempt to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.

Mr. Kushner, a multimilliionaire businessman and developer interested in how technology can reform organizations, launched an innovation office for the White House last week that intends to help reform government.

Mr. Kushner didn't speak with reporters on the trip to Iraq, his first ever here, which was preceded by an overnight stay at a U.S. military base in Germany.

He is accompanied by Tom Bossert, a former administration official under President George W. Bush who is serving as Mr. Trump's homeland security adviser.

Mr. Mattis and Gen. Dunford are completing a review of the strategy to fight the group. Mr. Trump signaled during the campaign and since assuming office that he had a plan to accelerate the fight against Islamic State, offering no details about what it might be.

No plan has emerged, and it now falls to Mr. Mattis and Gen. Dunford to come up with a new strategy. Gen. Dunford declined to discuss what the new strategy would look like. But, according to numerous U.S. officials, the strategy may largely resemble the old one, initiated under President Barack Obama, with tweaks and additions in the margins, U.S. officials said.

Gen. Dunford said he invited Messrs. Kushner and Bossert to join him on the trip some weeks ago so they could see the work troops are doing here, since they will be part of the decision on strategy.

"I think anyone who's involved in the discussion on where we go strategically -- having good situational awareness about what's happening tactically and hear it first hand and unfiltered, how our advisers assess the Iraqi security forces, both the opportunities and the challenges -- will feed into somebody's strategic view," Gen. Dunford told reporters traveling with him on a military jet.

The new strategy, or a refinement of it, may include additional U.S. troops for both Iraq and Syria.
