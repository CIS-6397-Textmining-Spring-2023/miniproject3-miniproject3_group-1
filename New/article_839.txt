Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. President Trump has fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director, citing his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’ emails.

The White House said Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recommended Mr. Comey’ dismissal.

The F.B.I. had also been investigating whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Russia to influence the election.

“hile I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,”r. Trump said in a letter to Mr. Comey.

We have live coverage of the reaction to this stunning development, and you can read the full White House statement and memos here.

And a longer read, from April: Our investigation into Mr. Comey’ role at the center of one of the biggest political firestorms in U.S. history.

2. Hours earlier, President Trump approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds with heavier weapons to fight \b ISIS\b0 , despite strong objections from Turkey.

The experienced fighters of the Y.P.G. militia will participate in the battle to retake Raqqa, the Pentagon said. But Turkey insists that the militia is linked to a Kurdish insurgent group.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington next week, and the decision is likely to be at the top of the agenda.

3. Moon Jae-in, the child of North Korean refugees, was elected president of South Korea, returning the country’ liberals to power.

Mr. Moon, above left, seeks dialogue with North Korea over its weapons program, an approach favored by China, but not by President Trump, who wants to squeeze Pyongyang with sanctions.

The vote caps a remarkable national drama in which a corruption scandal, mass protests and impeachment forced Mr. Moon’ predecessor from office.

4. As many as 245 migrants were feared dead in two shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, pushing the toll so far this year past 1,300.

The wrecks occurred over the weekend, but the toll was released only on Tuesday. The first occurred off Sicily, with 50 people rescued.

The second was off the coast of Libya, and only seven people were reported to have survived.

_____

5. New details emerged about the fatal police shooting of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards in Texas.

The arrest warrant for the 37-year-old officer who has been charged with murder states that a second officer had taken aggressive action in the moments leading up to the shooting.

Jordan was buried on Saturday. Above, his teammates on the high school football team at his funeral.

6. In the face of an opioid epidemic, a Massachusetts city is weighing a novel approach: installing lockboxes with Narcan, a medication that can revive people who have overdosed, on street corners for passers-by to administer.

That raises the question: Would you administer Narcan to a stranger who was dying of an opioid overdose in public?

_____

7. Is the middle-class American dream coming at the cost of poorer citizens?

The Pulitzer-winning author Matthew Desmond thinks so. His piece, “ow Homeownership Became the Engine of American Inequality,” was our most-read article today.

His thesis: The mortgage-interest deduction, which advocates say facilitates homeownership, actually inflates home prices and helps perpetuate inequality.

Above, a Massachusetts family that benefits from the deduction.

8. A study of Russian cosmonauts living in a capsule for 28 days may change what we know about salt and the human body.

The research upends traditional thinking about salt, suggesting that it makes you hungry, but not thirsty —nd may help burn calories.

Speaking of seasoning, our colleagues in Cooking introduced a beautiful new guide, “ow to Make Salad.”

It might sound simple, but they have some great suggestions for creative variations to complement, or even replace, your entree.

9. No one has ever reached the top of the Himalayan peak K2 in winter.

Many have died trying. It is the world’ second-highest, but most dangerous mountain, with hurricane-strength winds and temperatures that drop as low as minus-80 Fahrenheit.

This winter, a group of Polish climbers will attempt it. Our sportswriter went to meet them in Krakow, where they are training for the mission.

_____

10. Finally, Jimmy Kimmel offered an apology of sorts for his emotional monologue about his newborn son last week.

“ would like to apologize for saying that children in America should have health care,”e deadpanned.

And we might be in for some surprises on “he Late Show”onight. Stephen Colbert has an all-star lineup, with appearances by “aily Show”lumni Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee and John Oliver.

Above, a recent appearance by Mr. Stewart.

Have a great night.
