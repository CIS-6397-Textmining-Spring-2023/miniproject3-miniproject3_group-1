Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

One in custody after New York explosion.

• lone suspect was in serious condition after an explosion this morning in a tunnel that connects the Times Square and Port Authority subway stations, the Police Department said.

The man, identified by the police as Akayed Ullah, 27, from Brooklyn, had been wearing an explosive device, said a senior city official who declined to be identified because the investigation was continuing.

The Fire Department reported four injuries. The two subway stations and the Port Authority Bus Terminal were evacuated.

•ayor Bill de Blasio called the blast an attempted terrorist attack and said no other devices had been found.

The president vs. the presidency.

As he ends his first year in office, Donald Trump is redefining the presidency.

In interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress, our reporters found a man who “iews himself less as a titan dominating the world stage than a maligned outsider engaged in a struggle to be taken seriously.”

Mr. Trump reasons that his approach got him to the White House, so it must be the right one.

Among the highlights of our behind-the-scenes report:

•“or most of the year, people inside and outside Washington have been convinced that there is a strategy behind Mr. Trump’ actions. But there is seldom a plan apart from pre-emption, self-defense, obsession and impulse.”

•rmed with Twitter and fueled by Diet Coke, the president spends at least four hours a day —nd sometimes as much as twice that —n front of a TV. (Mr. Trump disputed the characterization today.)

• novice who is skeptical of anything that does not come from inside his bubble, Mr. Trump is, aides say, learning that a president cannot rule by fiat but must work with Republican leaders.

•enator Lindsey Graham, once a fierce critic of Mr. Trump’ but increasingly an ally, said the presidency was still “ work in progress.”t this point, Mr. Graham said, “verything’ possible, from complete disaster to a home run.”

Alabama Democrat gets quiet help.

•oug Jones remains a slight underdog to the Republican Roy Moore in Tuesday’ special Senate election.

But groups outside the state have been working hard to assist Mr. Jones, while also trying to avoid appearing to dictate whom Alabamians should support.

The effort received an unexpected lift on Sunday when Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican, said: “ couldn’ vote for Roy Moore. The state of Alabama deserves better.”

•he race has revolved almost entirely around Mr. Moore’ divisive views and allegations of improper behavior toward teenagers. Here are some of the policy issues the uproar has overshadowed.

An arsenal “nlike anything we’e ever seen.”

•xtremist forces, which have limited access to global arms markets, routinely manufacture their own weapons. But the Islamic State has taken the practice to new levels.

Reports provided to The Times detail the weapons the militant group has developed, including chemical rockets and space heaters rigged with explosives.

•fter more than three years of fighting, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State on Saturday. Analysts warned that it did not mean the end of the ISIS threat.

Puerto Rico’ long road to recovery.

•arge parts of the island continue to be without electricity after September’ hurricanes, and the sick and elderly have suffered most acutely.

A look inside  Puerto Rico’ largest housing project for low-income seniors helps explain the storms’mpact.

•fficially, 64 people were killed as a result of Hurricane Maria. The actual death toll may be more than 1,000, a Times analysis found.

“he Daily” Alabama’ Senate race.

•he Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this week. Investors want to know what’ next.

•he F.C.C. is set to repeal net neutrality rules on Thursday, one of the headlines to watch this week.

•.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here’ a snapshot of global markets.

•uotation of the day.

“hen you grow up in France, none of the heroes you learn about are entrepreneurs. When someone gets rich in France, people immediately ask, ‘hat did he do to make this money? He must be a nasty person.’”

—Brigitte Granville, a professor at Queen Mary University of London who was raised in France, on shifting views toward business as the country tries to make the most of Britain’ exit from the European Union.

Back Story

“reed is good.”oday is the 30th anniversary of the release of “all Street.”

Michael Douglas won an Oscar for his role as Gordon Gekko, the ruthless corporate raider who takes a young stockbroker named Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, under his wing.

The movie was meant as a harsh critique of the excesses of 1980s capitalism —ut it became wildly popular with actual Wall Street types. (When it came out, our critic suggested that its moralizing was its weak point: “he movie crashes in a heap of platitudes,”incent Canby wrote.)

The director, Oliver Stone, said that in a twist, many young people told him it had inspired them to work on Wall Street. Even years later, brokers would tell him, “ou’e the man!”

Mr. Stone discussed the film’ legacy in this 2009 Times video. He said it was “isunderstood by some, because it was about a horrible thing that was going on, about how people would worship money at all costs.”

That interview took place as he was preparing to film the sequel, “all Street: Money Never Sleeps,”eleased in 2010. Our critic called it “ corrective, a parody and a sly act of auto-homage.”

Karen Zraick contributed reporting.
