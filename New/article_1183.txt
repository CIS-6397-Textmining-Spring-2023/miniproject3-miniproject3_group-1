Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. President Trump fired his famously vulgar communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, at the request of his new chief of staff, John Kelly, above.

The reason there was a new chief of staff, of course, is because the last one, Reince Priebus, was ousted last week after a blistering attack from Mr. Scaramucci.

Notice, above right, a familiar face? That’ Sean Spicer, who resigned after Mr. Scaramucci’ appointment, apparently fulfilling his promise to ease the transition to a new White House communications office.

Michael Barbaro and the team behind “he Daily”ave created a new podcast to keep up with the characters remaking the capital. It’ called “he New Washington.”

2. Mr. Kelly, a retired general, is known as a beacon of discipline. President Trump has praised him for doing “ great job”s head of Homeland Security, where he presided over a substantial increase in the number of undocumented immigrants rounded up for deportation.

We spent a day with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the frontline soldiers in the crackdown. Our reporter described seeing families separated on “he Daily.” Above, a father is arrested.

In other immigration news, Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., was convicted of criminal contempt for defying a court order to stop rounding up immigrants. He may face jail time.

3. The Kremlin is pushing ahead with plans to force the American Embassy to dismiss hundreds of employees in retaliation for new sanctions.

Most of the 755 employees to be dropped are likely to be Russian nationals working for the embassy in Moscow, above, or U.S. consulates in other Russian cities. Still, it’ Russia’ harshest diplomatic move since Soviet times.

_____

4. The Treasury Department announced new financial sanctions against Venezuela’ president following a much-criticized referendum on rewriting its Constitution.

The country saw its deadliest day of unrest in three months as the vote was held on Sunday. The government said the vote would bring peace, but many avoided the ballot box, and an array of other countries rejected the results.

The vote effectively liquidated the political opposition and gave the left complete control over a country that is deeply divided and in an economic and political tailspin.

_____

5. Even by the brutal standards of the Syrian civil war, children growing up in areas ruled by the Islamic State have experienced and witnessed astonishing brutality. Schools have been closed for years. Polio has made a comeback. Boys have been forced to watch executions and recruited to fight.

Aid workers and people who have escaped say the children have nightmares, play war, recall ISIS propaganda songs and ask for guns. “ou don’ see children living their normal age,”aid a man who fled Raqqa. “ou see grown-up men.”

_____

6. Los Angeles officials are expected to announce a deal to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, while Paris will take the 2024 games.

The projected cost is $5.3 billion, though L.A. officials expect it to come from private sources. The plan depends on stadiums and arenas belonging to major sports teams and universities, or left over from when it hosted the 1984 games.

_____

7. In memoriam: Sam Shepard, above, the avant-garde American playwright and Oscar-nominated actor, 73; and Jeanne Moreau, the sensual, gravel-voiced actress of the French New Wave, 89.

Here’ how to stream five great movies featuring Mr. Shepard, and highlights from our many decades of reviews of his work. Our fashion writer said he was also a style icon: “n his understated masculinity he was a throwback, an endangered species. He seemed vaguely tortured, and he wasn’ about to tell you why.”

_____

8. Couples who live together share a lot of things: beds, bathrooms, food, toiletries. But one thing they might not expect to share? Skin bacteria. Especially on their feet.

A study of 10 couples found that each person significantly influenced the microbial communities on a lover’ skin. That’ the mini-ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms living on the body.

What types of information can experts tell about you from your microbiome? Probably more than you think. Take our quiz to see.

9. This weekend’ box office tallies were a stark reminder that the tastes of movie critics and the moviegoing public often diverge —harply.

The stylish “tomic Blonde,” above, sputtered, while “he Emoji Movie,” which horrified critics (including our own) was a hit.

The No. 1 movie in North America was again Christopher Nolan’ sophisticated “unkirk,” which benefited from strong turnout at IMAX theaters.

_____

10. Finally, will Cersei’ venom succeed as a long-term strategy? That’ the question at the heart of our latest “ame of Thrones”ecap. Be warned, spoilers abound.
