Back Story

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was joined by the king and queen of Sweden  this week for the opening of the Bayreuth Festival , a tradition The Times once called “the Woodstock of the opera set .”

The festival was started in 1876 by Richard Wagner, the German composer. It is still managed by his descendants and devoted exclusively to his operas, such as the “ing”ycle and “ristan und Isolde.”hey are performed in the theater he designed and built, and some fans wait decades for tickets .

Bayreuth has something of an operatic history of its own. Wagner, who died in 1883, was a notorious anti-Semite , and in the 1920s and ’0s the festival became associated with the Nazis. The opera “ie Meistersinger von Nünberg”as a favorite of Hitler’.

“ie Meistersinger”as also the opening performance this year, led by Barrie Kosky , the first Jewish director in the festival’ history. Above, a scene from Mr. Kosky’ “ie Meistersinger.”

Next year’ festival will feature another milestone: Yuval Sharon will become the first American to direct a production.

“or me, Bayreuth has always been this very holy place,”Mr. Sharon told us earlier this month . “’e already had five anxiety dreams about it, so that means I’ on the right track.”
