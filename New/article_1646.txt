WASHINGTONâ€”resident Donald Trump said Thursday he doesn't see a role for the U.S. in seeking to stabilize Libya, saying Washington should instead focus on combating Islamic State.

"I do not see a role in Libya," he said, speaking at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. "I think right now the U.S. has enough roles," he added, citing its efforts in "getting rid of ISIS" as "very effective."

Speaking about Libya, Mr. Gentiloni called for nations to "work against the division of the country in order to stabilize it." He praised the U.S.'s anti-ISIS efforts in Libya to "prevent the consolidation of an important base for terrorism."

The U.S. is part of an international consortium behind Libya's so-called Government of National Accord, led by Faiez Serraj.

However, Russia has backed a rival political organization in recent months, throwing its support behind Gen. Khalifa Haftar, prompting growing concern at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Washington has largely kept its distance from Gen. Haftar, who has had links to the Central Intelligence Agency and was part of an effort to oust Moammar Gadhafi in the late 1980s.

European countries have lobbied Russia to use its influence with Gen. Haftar, who has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, to get him to reconcile with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.
