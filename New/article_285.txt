Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

•atalonia’ disputed referendum on independence from Spain descended into violence. Hundreds were injured as riot police officers sent from other parts of the country dispersed voters, at times using rubber bullets, and seized ballots.

This video shows some of the violent clashes. Here are some of the best photos on a day in which even high-level soccer games turned political. One of our correspondents spent the day with high school students in Barcelona who used diversions to sneak ballot boxes to safety.

In the end, both sides claimed victory: The Catalan government said that 90 percent of some 2.3 million voters were in favor of secession. The government in Madrid said that the referendum had been disrupted. Unions called a strike for tomorrow.

•n one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history, a gunman firing from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas killed more than 50 people and injured at least 200 at an outdoor country music festival Sunday night.

The police said they had killed the gunman, identified as Stephen Paddock, 64. Here are the latest updates.

•n southern France, two women were killed yesterday in a knife attack at Marseille’ main train station. The assailant was then fatally shot by a military patrol. Prosecutors said they had opened a terrorism investigation.

Another such attack occurred in Canada, where the police arrested a man suspected of driving two vehicles into pedestrians and stabbing a police officer, injuring five people. The police said that they found an Islamic State flag in one of the cars but that they believe the suspect was acting alone.

•n Iraq, thousands of civilians are fleeing the Iraqi military’ push to evict the Islamic State from the city of Hawija, its last major urban stronghold in the country.

Some local officials fear that hundreds of ISIS combatants used the exodus to escape the siege. Our correspondent witnessed the interrogation of one such man detained in Kirkuk.

Separately, Iraqi Kurds appear to have underestimated the depth of international opposition to their vote on independence from Baghdad. Iraqi Kurdistan’ troubled economy is dependent on hostile neighbors, who have steadily increased pressure on the region’ government.

•n the United States, the Trump administration’ response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico became a heated political issue as supplies of food, water and cash dwindled and frustration grew among the island’ 3.4 million residents.

A team of our journalists spent 24 hours with people trying to survive. Here’ what they saw. More supplies and federal government personnel have begun to arrive, but the situation remains far from normal.

At his New Jersey golf club, President Trump lashed out against criticism, implying that residents were not doing enough to help themselves. He plans to travel to Puerto Rico tomorrow.

Back Story

Today, India is celebrating Gandhi Jayanti, honoring the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in 1869.

For leading the nonviolent struggle to win India’ independence from the British Raj, he is considered the father of the nation. But first, he helped lead the fight against apartheid in South Africa.

Starting in the 1890s, his focus was on improving the lot of Indians there, but by the time he left in 1914, he had embraced the empowerment of blacks as well, saying, “his land is theirs by birth.”

Beloved around the world for standing up for the humble and eschewing violence in the pursuit of justice, he is often quoted. But he is also often misquoted.

These are some of the statements commonly attributed to him, but for which there is no authoritative corroboration:

“e the change you wish to see in the world.”“n eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.”

And: “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”

That last has resurfaced recently, cited in tweets by Mr. Trump and a leader of the German far-right party Alternative for Germany.
