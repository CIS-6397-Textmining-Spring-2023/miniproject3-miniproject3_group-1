MOSCOW -- Russian armed forces launched a cruise-missile attack on Islamic State targets in Syria's Hama province, the defense ministry said Friday.

The defense ministry statement said the Kalibr cruise missiles struck infrastructure used to store weapons and ammunition for militants coming from Raqqa, where the U.S. seeks to squeeze the group out of the urban stronghold.

Russia said it had been monitoring Islamic State militants escaping from Raqqa to the south over the past week. The six missiles were launched from Russia's permanent naval grouping in the east Mediterranean.

"Remains of the terrorists and the IS terrorist infrastructure were destroyed by Russian Air Force's bomber airstrikes," the statement said.

Russia said it had informed Turkey and Israel of its attack plans before launching strikes. It was unclear whether Russia had informed the U.S. of the plans through a special military channel used to ensure the countries' planes operate safely in the airspace over Syria.

Russia said this week after U.S. jet fighters downed a Syrian war plane that it would pull out of a cooperation agreement that sets out the use of the deconfliction line.

U.S. officials have said that line has stayed open despite Russian threats. In response to the U.S. strike on the Syrian aircraft, Russia also said it would track U.S. and coalition aircraft in Syria as targets.

Both Russia and the U.S. have stepped up their attacks on Islamic State, although the U.S. has had its attention diverted by a series of recent confrontations with forces backing the Syrian government.
