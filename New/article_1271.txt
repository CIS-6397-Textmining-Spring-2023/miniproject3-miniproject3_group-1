Back Story

Like music? Then you might want to check out the Montreux Jazz Festival.

It’ underway on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. If you happen to be —ike us —lsewhere, you can stream the concerts live on the festival’ website.

Once devoted almost entirely to European jazz, it has evolved into something far more inclusive. Its founder, Claude Nobs, was criticized for continuing to use the term “azz”o describe the event even after other styles of music were introduced.

“ontreux Jazz is a brand name, and most of the people know what to expect,”r. Nobs, who died in 2013, said in a 2006 interview with Billboard magazine.

This year, the festival’ eclectic program included sold-out concerts by the British pop stars The Pet Shop Boys and the American R&B singer Lauryn Hill. The Senegalese singer Youssou N’our is scheduled to perform on the final day, next Saturday.

The festival has also been a prolific venue for recording. The pianist Bill Evans recorded a Grammy-winning album there in the second year, kicking off a series that comprises what is now an extensive audio archive recognized by Unesco.
