WASHINGTONâ€”gyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi will visit the White House on April 3 for a meeting with President Donald Trump, an administration official said Wednesday.

It will be the first meeting between the two leaders, who spoke days after Mr. Trump took office and agreed then on setting up a visit. They also spoke during the presidential transition after Mr. Trump won the November election, and met last fall during the presidential campaign.

Mr. Sisi has been intent on closer U.S. ties under the Trump administration, committing his help in countering terrorism. Mr. Trump in the January conversation pledged his full backing for Egypt.

Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. military and foreign aid, getting about $1.5 billion a year Mr. Trump in his first federal budget has proposed a 31% cut in State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development funding, which stands to affect recipients.

State Department officials said the cuts, if approved by Congress, wouldn't affect funding to Israel, but that aid to other countries is being reviewed.
