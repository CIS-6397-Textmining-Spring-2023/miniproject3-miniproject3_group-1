Back Story

It’ one of the most famous movie images of all time: Marilyn Monroe standing astride a subway vent and laughing as her white dress billows above her waist.

That scene, from “The Seven Year Itch,”as shot on this day in 1954 around 1 a.m. on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Billy Wilder, the director, had invited the news media to drum up buzz for the film. The breeze came from a fan placed under the subway grate.

Off camera, that night was hardly comedy. Hundreds of gawkers, mostly men, showed up on the set and heckled Ms. Monroe. Her husband, Joe DiMaggio, also appeared and was infuriated. She filed for divorce weeks later.

Photographs from that night circulated everywhere, but the film footage was never used. Mr. Wilder reshot the scene on a Hollywood lot. (The Times learned of other video taken that night in New York and wrote about it in January.)

Ms. Monroe died eight years later after an overdose of sleeping pills. Mr. DiMaggio sent fresh flowers to her grave twice a week for the rest of his life.

Charles McDermid contributed reporting.
