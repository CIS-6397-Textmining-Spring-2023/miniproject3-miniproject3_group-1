KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Suspected militants linked to Islamic State were stopped just short of attacking Saudi royals during King Salman's recent trip here, Malaysian police said.

"We got them in the nick of time," Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said. Three teams of militants had planned attacks on the Saudis, he said, but he declined to give details. One group comprised four Yemenis, another an Indonesian and a Malaysian, and a third a man from an unspecified East Asian nation.

Malaysia, without identifying the targets, said the plotters were arrested between Feb. 21 and Feb. 26. Police said two of the men were directed by Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, a Malaysian who joined Islamic State in Syria in 2015, in preparing a car bomb. The Indonesian arrested had previously been deported to Turkey after trying to enter Syria, police said.

Police said the East Asian suspect, believed to have been living in Malaysia on a student visa since 2011, had suspected links to a regional terrorist group that uses Malaysia as a transit point and safe haven.

The Saudi king is on a monthlong tour of Asia to strengthen ties with a region the kingdom sees as a valuable economic partner and a hedge against an unpredictable U.S. government. Malaysia was the first stop.
