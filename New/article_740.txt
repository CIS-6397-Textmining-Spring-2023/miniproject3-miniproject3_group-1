Back Story

The dog has been man’ best friend, so to speak, for at least 15,000 years or so .

Breeding them for specific traits eventually led to the founding of the Kennel Club  in London on this day in 1873. The club runs the annual Crufts dog show  in Birmingham, England, one of the biggest in the world.

Descended from wolves, dogs were the first animals to be domesticated, an advance that appears to have occurred independently in ancient cultures around the world.

By the mid-1800s, breeding had become fashionable, and dog shows were a craze. A British politician, Sewallis Shirley, established the first Kennel Club to organize the breeds and regulate the exhibitions.

Kennel clubs register purebred dogs, record pedigrees and work to maintain breed standards. The clubs have been criticized by some for promoting inbreeding that destroys genetic diversity, among other complaints.

Maybe the relationship between humans and dogs isn’ so complicated. As Charles M. Schulz, the “eanuts”artoonist who created Snoopy, once said: “appiness is a warm puppy.”
