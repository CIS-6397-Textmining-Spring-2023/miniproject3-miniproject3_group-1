Here are the week’ top stories, and a look ahead.

1. President Trump’ missile strike against a Syrian air base brought a glimmer of hope to some of the Syrians trapped, displaced or exiled in six years of brutal war —nd set off a geopolitical shock wave.

The strike, in response to a lethal chemical attack, found support among some of his toughest critics, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham and drew criticism from some of his strongest right-wing and conservative supporters.

The U.S.-led forces battling the Islamic State in Syria have sharply reduced airstrikes, and are awaiting signals of whether Russian or Syrian government forces will respond.

2. President Trump had argued against intervening in the Syrian civil war, pushed for stronger ties with Russia and called China an “nemy.”

Then last week happened.

Mr. Trump has demonstrated a “ighly improvisational and situational approach,”ur chief White House correspondent writes. “o the extent that a Trump Doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this: Don’ get roped in by doctrine.”

In another show of U.S. military readiness, a naval strike group is moving toward the Korean Peninsula.

3. Judge Neil Gorsuch will be sworn in Monday to the Supreme Court, filling the seat left vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia.

That simple sentence is the culmination of a year of partisan scuffling that erupted into a game-changing showdown in the Senate, and a definitive win for the Republicans and for Mr. Trump.

Judge Gorsuch is 49, and could serve on the court for 30 years or more.

4 . B omb s struck two Coptic Christian churches in Egypt, killing at least 40 during Palm Sunday services. The attacks came just weeks before Pope Francis is scheduled to visit country.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility.

And in Sweden, the authorities identified the suspect in an attack using a stolen beer truck as a 39-year-old Uzbek asylum seeker with ISIS sympathies who had been ordered to leave the country.

5. White House infighting reached such a peak that President Trump admonished the warring factions to “ork this out” and, according to insiders, is said to be considering a shake-up of his senior staff.

Stephen Bannon, the president’ chief strategist, has had a series of dust-ups with Jared Kushner, the president’ son-in-law and senior adviser, and has become increasingly isolated.

He was removed last week from a privileged seat at the National Security Council.

6. “oved the part about how to treat women! This guy’ the worst!”

That Amazon reviewer, commenting on Bill O’eilly’ No. 1 new best seller, captured the feel of public backlash after our report that  the talk-show host and Fox News had paid a total of $13 million to settle claims of sexual harassment or verbal abuse. Dozens of companies have pulled their ads from his show.

Some of his fans say they’e troubled, but still trust him.

_____

7. It’ official.

Gov. Jerry Brown of California lifted the drought emergency that was called more than three years ago after a water shortage was erased by a very wet winter.

But he had a caveat: “he next drought could be around the corner. Conservation must remain a way of life.”

_____

8. A “olden age”f space exploration: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, shared his vision as he showed off a rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule designed to take tourists into space for panoramic views of Earth.

He said that he was selling about $1 billion a year in Amazon stock to finance his rocket company, Blue Origin, with the goal of enabling people to live and work in space —n ambition shared by his fellow technology titan, Elon Musk of SpaceX.

In other business news, the U.S. employers added 98,000 jobs in March, fewer than half the monthly number for January and February.

9. Who will take home the green jacket?

The world’ top professional golfers head into their final round at Augusta National Golf Club for the 2017 Masters. (2 p.m. Eastern, CBS)

Sergio Garcia finished Saturday tied with Justin Rose. He has performed well despite a long history of struggling at the tournament. Our golf writer called Augusta his “ersonal torture chamber.”

And Wednesday is the final day of the N.B.A. regular season.

_____

10. New Mexico has a new law against so-called lunch shaming, or practices that embarrass children who don’ have money to pay for a meal.

It’ believed to be the first of its kind. Elsewhere, cafeteria workers are instructed to take away a children’ meals if they can’ pay, force them to clean tables in front of classmates or have “ Need Lunch Money”tamped on their arm.

_____

11. “e left us in stitches.”

That’ one of our editors recalling the lacerating comments the comedian Don Rickles would make on visits to Elaine’, the long-gone celebrity hangout in Manhattan, telling jokes off the clock.

Mr. Rickles, the comedian known for hurling insults at audience members (they could be tourists or Frank Sinatra), died  Thursday at  age  90.

_____

12. Binge watchers, get comfortable.

You have plenty to choose from this month, including the return of the “reaking Bad”pinoff “etter Call Saul”Monday on AMC) and “ystery Science Theater 3000”Friday on Netflix). Here are some other coming options. Above, “rockmire.”

And shorter term, here’ what to cook, watch, listen to and more to ride out the weekend.

13. In uplifting news, your best work may be ahead of you. Way ahead of you.

Consider the case of John Goodenough, a 94-year-old professor at the University of Texas at Austin who, with his team, recently filed a patent application for “ new kind of battery that, if it works as promised, would be so cheap, lightweight and safe that it would revolutionize electric cars.”

His age and life experience, he argued, only helped him. “’ old enough to know you can’ close your mind to new ideas.”

Have a great week.
