That a top American official had to sneak into Afghanistan after 16 years of war, thousands of lives lost and hundreds of billions of dollars spent testifies to the U.S. stalemate with the Taliban, a foe that appears to be growing stronger.

Back Story

The Olympic torch is scheduled to be lit today in Greece, beginning the countdown to the next Winter Games.

The flame will travel more than 5,000 miles east to South Korea, arriving Nov. 1 —00 days before the 2018 Olympics begin.

Starting in the city of Incheon, the torch will cross South Korea, with stops in nine provinces and eight major cities before arriving in Pyeongchang for the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.

The torch lighting goes back to the ancient games, but the Olympic flame made its first modern appearance at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. The relay began with the 1936 Games in Berlin.

The torch itself is designed by the host country. The Times noted in 2010: “he modern Olympic Games have become as much a global contest among designers and architects as among athletes. Each Olympics is expected to produce a logo, a signature building —nd a characteristic torch that symbolizes local tradition and national character.”

The torch for the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul featured a bright metal body and Korean graphic elements. The five-pronged shape of the 2018 torch represents the Korean symbol for Pyeongchang.
