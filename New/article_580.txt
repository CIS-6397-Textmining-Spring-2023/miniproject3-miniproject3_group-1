2016 has been a long year, but there’ a recap for ya right here

Our nation’ in distress and wonderin’hat’ next

Divided we stand over our president elect

Some protest, saying “ove Trumps Hate”

Others chant “ake America Great”

—he opening of a rap by Riya Ganpati, one of the winners of our contest

Every December, we invite teenagers around the world to write raps about that year’ news. While we created our own year-end news quiz spotlighting the 60 or so stories we found most important, our contestants —orking alone or in small groups —ere encouraged to focus on the news that mattered most to them. As a result, everything from Brexit and terrorism to Harambe and Pokéon made an appearance.

However, this year’ contest, just like last year’, was dominated by one name, and we doubt we need to tell you whose that is. If you need a hint, however, here is just one of many rhymes about him:

2016 took a whole new direction

The Celebrity Apprentice guy, he won the election

The hip-hop experts at Flocabulary, our annual partners for this contest, chose 11 favorites from 800 submissions. We’e reproduced them here in no particular order and exactly as originally written.

Thank you to all the students and teachers who participated. We end as we began —ith wise words from the pen of the winner Riya Ganpati:

2016 left questions no one knows what they mean, hoping for answers in 2017!
