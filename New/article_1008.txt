Back Story

From Lawfare: Reporters only get to print a fraction of what they are told, given constraints of space, time and relevancy. In this post from Lawfare, a much-read legal affairs blog, its editor gives a riveting first-person account of what, how and why he told a Times reporter this week about his conversations with James Comey about Donald Trump, information that produced a front-page scoop. —ichael Wines, national correspondent

Simply Devastating

From Time: Russia may have found a way to alter the course of real-life events by manipulating public opinion through phishing, fake news and social media propaganda. What’ fascinating is that these tactics are not technically advanced —isinformation tactics were used in the Cold War —ut the use of computing power to segment and target millions of people at once is forcing security experts to rethink their defensive measures. A great read for anyone who enjoys a good spy tale. —una Sandvik, director of information security, newsroom

_____

E Pluribus, Pluribus

From The New York Times: What a week for news and for columnists from across the internet (and across ideologies) reacting to that news. First, read about how the right, left and center reacted to James Comey’ memo about his meetings with President Trump here. When you’e done with that, check out how political writers responded to the announcement of Robert Mueller III as special counsel, and Vice President Pence’ role on the transition team and in the administration. —nna Dubenko, senior digital strategist

_____

Blasted From the Past

From The Atlantic: Graeme Wood is particularly gifted at explaining abhorrent ideas; his 2015 story on \b ISIS\b0  remains a useful resource for understanding the group’ theology and ideology. And the fact that he went to high school with Richard Spencer, the young godfather of the “lt-right,”lso solves a problem that a lot of editors and journalists have faced in dealing with Mr. Spencer and his ideas —amely whether we really should dignify them with extensive consideration, given that it’ unclear how many Americans really subscribe to them. Mr. Wood’ personal connection with Mr. Spencer lets him interrogate Mr. Spencer’ ideas at length without overhyping their influence. —ill Wasik, deputy editor, New York Times Magazine

_____

Framing the Debate

From The Ringer: More and more, politics and political conversations seem to be happening concurrently, as if in parallel universes. This piece sums it up with this thought: “e’e all definitely arguing, but if we’e not arguing competing points in the same conversation …s it even an argument?”—rashant Rao, deputy Europe business editor

_____

Walking It Back

From The Economist: It’ a time-honored form of apology: “ misspoke.”ut it also often serves as a diversion tactic, one that confuses a “ypo”a casual error of speech or transcription) with a “hinko”a substantive mistake that betrays legitimate ignorance). —tephen Hiltner, Staff Editor, Times Insider

_____

Man and Myth

From The New Yorker: J.F.K. would be 100 this year, and Thomas Mallon writes a moving, quirky memory piece about a president who still drives so many imaginations. Another benefit: He discusses a new book on Kennedy by two wonderful former colleagues of mine at The Boston Globe: Curtis Wilkie and Thomas Oliphant. —teven Erlanger, London bureau chief

_____

What the Bullet Took

From The Washington Post: A beautifully written, heartbreaking column about a man left paralyzed by a bullet in his back and his death weeks later, just as he was starting to have hope for the future again. —ernanda Santos, Phoenix Bureau chief

_____

Company Towns

From New York Magazine: This is a tale of two Ford towns, one gearing up for good times after Trump browbeat the company into adding hundreds of jobs there, the other enduring a 50 percent cut in tax revenues and ending municipal retiree health benefits after layoffs of an almost equal number. Along the way it has a lot to say about how the physical work of automaking has changed, and how tenuous the future feels in both places. —evin McKenna, deputy business editor

_____

Something Completely Different

From The Awl: Sometimes, the perfect antidote to news fatigue is to read about your favorite mid-90s power ballad before watching the music video nine times in a row. —ichael Gold, social media strategy editor
