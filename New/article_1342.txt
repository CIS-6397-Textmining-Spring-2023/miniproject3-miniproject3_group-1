HAITI

Bus Plows Into

Festival, Killing 34

A bus plowed into people at a street festival in the city of Gonaives, Haiti, early Sunday, killing at least 34 people and injuring 17, officials said.

At about 3 a.m. a passenger bus first hit two people at a bus stop and then continued into a crowd of people participating in an Easter season musical celebration, said Josepth Faustin, civil-defense coordinator for the region. Angry festivalgoers attacked the bus and tried to burn it before police rescued the passengers, Mr. Faustin said.

IRAQ

Militants in Mosul Are

Now Surrounded

The remaining western Mosul neighborhoods held by Islamic State are now completely surrounded and the group has lost more than 60% of the territory it once held in Iraq, a coalition official said. "ISIS is trapped," Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy, said on Sunday in Baghdad. The Iraqi army took control of the last road leading out of Mosul late Saturday.

Iraqi forces are currently fighting Islamic State in western Mosul after declaring the city's east "fully liberated" in January.

ETHIOPIA

Trash Avalanche

Leaves 46 Dead

A mountain of trash gave way in a garbage dump on the outskirts of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, killing at least 46 people and leaving several dozen missing, residents said.

Most of the dead were women and children, and the death toll was expected to rise, Addis Ababa city spokeswoman Dagmawit Moges said.

It wasn't immediately clear what caused Saturday night's collapse at the Koshe Garbage Landfill, which buried several makeshift homes and concrete buildings.
