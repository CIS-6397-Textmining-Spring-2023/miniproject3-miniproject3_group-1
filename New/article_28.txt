Good morning.

Here’ what you need to know:

•resident Trump made a bellicose debut speech at the United Nations, threatening to “otally destroy”orth Korea and referring to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “ocket Man.”

He called the Iran nuclear deal “n embarrassment,”romised to “rush the loser terrorists”n the Middle East and said the U.S. was prepared to confront Venezuela’ authoritarian government. (Here’ the video.)

Our White House correspondent noted a dissonance between Mr. Trump’ vision of renewed sovereignty of the nation state and his threats to act aggressively against some countries.

•exico was hit with a 7.1-magnitude earthquake, just two weeks after it was struck by its most powerful tremor in a century. At least 216 people were killed. Millions poured into the streets and remained there, fearful of returning inside. Images show crushed cars and falling facades.

Separately in Moscow, a towering monument to Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the AK-47, was unveiled to the sounds of the Soviet anthem and Orthodox prayers. There was no mention of the untold millions killed by the weapon.

Back Story

For today, a slice of culinary history. The Times introduced readers to pizza 73 years ago today as “ pie made from a yeast dough and filled with any number of different centers.”

“ith the dexterity of a drum major wielding a baton, the baker picks one up and twirls it around, first in one hand and then in the other,”the report said, describing Luigino’ Pizzeria Alla Napoletana in Times Square.

In the early 1800s, Naples was famous for working poor, the lazzaroni. Pizza was the answer to their need for quick and cheap food. Antica Pizzeria Port’lba opened in Naples in 1830 and is widely thought to be the world’ first pizzeria.

When Neapolitans began migrating in large numbers to the U.S., they brought their tradition of wood-oven bakeries. The first U.S. pizzeria opened in New York in 1905.

Some things have changed. Pizza is now embedded in much of the world’ culinary fabric. (Last week, our dining critic proposed that Jersey City actually has New York’ best pizza.)

But the gluttony that pizza can inspire is enduring.

“ach one will make four portions,”he Times wrote in 1944. “lthough many people can do away with a whole pie single-handed.”
