Back Story

Our departing book critic, Michiko Kakutani, above, has been hailed as the most powerful critic in the English-speaking world .

Her output during 38 years at The Times attracted plenty of response, and on the day she announced her plans to step down , a colleague revealed a letter that Ms. Kakutani received early in her career .

Ms. Kakutani had written a profile of Pat Carroll , an actress who was then portraying the writer Gertrude Stein on stage. She described her home as “illed with books by Stein and about Stein, as well as xeroxed Ph.D. theses and obscure literary journals.”

The next day, Aug. 2, 1979, a letter addressed to “r. Michiko Kakutani”rrived, sent by an employee of Xerox , a company famous for protecting its brand name.

“here is no adjective ‘erox,’”he letter explained. “f in the future you wish to use the name Xerox , it should be used with a capital ‘’nd no ‘d’”
