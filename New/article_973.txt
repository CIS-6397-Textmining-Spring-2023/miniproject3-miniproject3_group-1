Back Story

“tar Wars”ppeared in theaters for the first time on this day in 1977, unleashing one of the greatest pop culture explosions this galaxy has ever seen.

The Force drew us in as much as anyone: Over the past 40 years, The Times has published thousands of articles about “tar Wars”nd the universe that surrounds it.

Some now seem quaint: In a prerelease interview, George Lucas described Chewbacca as “ cross between a large bear, a dog and a monkey.”Chewie, as we know now, is a 200-year-old Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk and one of the greatest sidekicks in the history of film.)

Other reports were serious: We covered President Ronald Reagan’ “tar Wars”ntimissile system in the 1980s, the “tar Wars”“iracy menace”f bootleg films in Hong Kong, and the obituaries of franchise stars like Sir Alec Guinness, in 2000, and Carrie Fisher, in December.

We also tried to be playful. We covered the recent campaign to make Jediism a religion, and the “tar Wars”socks worn by the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

And maybe we got a little obsessed, too. Last year, we offered “tar Wars”eaching ideas —rom “ackle Shakespeare With Yoda, You Will”o an economics primer, “he Death Star, Too Big to Fail?”

In any case, may The Force be with you.
