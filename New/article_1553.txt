CANBERRA, Australia -- Russia is a bigger security threat than Islamic State, based on its willingness to challenge the democratic foundations of the U.S. by interfering in elections, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said during a visit to Australia.

Mr. McCain, who was in Australia to discuss Asia-Pacific security issues, said Russian President Vladimir Putin was the premier challenge to American security.

"I think ISIS can do terrible things and I worry a lot about what is happening with the Muslim faith," he told Australian ABC state television on Monday. "But it's the Russians who tried to destroy the very fundamental of democracy, and that is to change the outcome of an American election."

Mr. McCain recently walked back comments that the controversy surrounding investigations into potential collusion between associates of President Donald Trump and the Russian government had reached "Watergate size and scale," saying he had seen no evidence Russia had succeeded in swaying the U.S. presidential-election process. "But they tried and they are still trying," he said.

The visit by the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee was part of an Asia tour to outline a blueprint for the U.S. to invest nearly $8 billion bulking up its military presence in the region by upgrading infrastructure, conducting additional exercises and deploying more forces and ships.
