A deadly bombing struck an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, on Monday night. Traumatized fans, including children, screamed and ran. Parents separated from their children during the mayhem were told to go to nearby hotels, where many concertgoers had taken refuge.

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the bombing, the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since 2005.

The assailant died in the attack and a 23-year-old man was arrested Tuesday southwest of the city center. Investigators were examining security and dashboard camera footage to piece together events surrounding the bombing and identify potential collaborators.

Ms. Grande, who was unharmed, wrote on Twitter that she was “roken”fter the attack. “rom the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’ have words,”he wrote. Her message was reposted hundreds of thousands of times.
