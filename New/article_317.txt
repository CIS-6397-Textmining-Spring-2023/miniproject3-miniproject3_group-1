Australian federal police said Chan Han Choi, 59, a naturalized citizen living in Sydney’ suburbs, had been arrested on charges of trying to help North Korea sell its missile parts and other military technology to “nternational entities” that were not further identified.

The U.S. stance on talks with the North is back to a unified insistence on preconditions: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a U-turn after a brief effort at conciliation.

In less surprising political news, President Trump expects to sign the Republican tax bill this week. He has called it a Christmas present for the entire nation, but the fine print reveals some will get nicer gifts than others.

Back Story

On Dec. 18, 1941, less than two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Sunday editor for The Times sent a memo to the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.

It said: “e ought to proceed with the puzzle, especially in view of the fact it is possible there will now be bleak blackout hours —r if not that then certainly a need for relaxation of some kind or other.”

That’ how a time of national grief helped lead to one of The Times’ most joyful and beloved features. The crossword puzzle debuted some two months later as a weekly feature in the Sunday magazine.

The editor, Margaret Farrar, followed a simple rule: good manners. She refused to allow unpleasant or impolite language — rule that’ still followed by The Times’ current crossword editor, Will Shortz.

Nowadays, we like to think of our crossword puzzle as the form’ gold standard.

But The Times didn’ always hold crosswords in high regard. In 1924, a Times opinion column called the completion of crosswords a “inful waste.”

Crossword solvers, the column claimed, “et nothing out of it except a primitive sort of mental exercise.”

Many of us would disagree.
