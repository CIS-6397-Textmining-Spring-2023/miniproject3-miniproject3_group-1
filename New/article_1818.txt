The recapture of Tal Afar by Iraqi forces is the latest in a string of victories against Islamic State as the militant group loses territory in the country. Here is a rundown of the major cities that were retaken as they happened.

Mar. 31, 2015: Tikrit falls to Iraqi forces, Islamic State's first major loss in Iraq and biggest setback since seizing swaths of territory across Iraq and Syria in 2014. Fighting for the city, symbolic as the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein, takes three months.

Nov. 13, 2015: Iraqi Kurdish fighters stream into Sinjar after announcing its retaking from the extremist group. The battle for the northern city is a then-rare victory against Islamic State in Iraq and involves some 7,500 Kurdish forces backed by the U.S.

Dec. 28, 2015: Iraqi forces declare victory in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. Fleeing residents describe near-starvation and use as human shields.

June 26, 2016: Fallujah is declared liberated by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The city, once used as a staging ground by Islamic State, is widely seen as a test of the army's preparedness for a coming battle to retake the much larger city of Mosul.

July 11, 2017: Islamic State's Iraqi stronghold Mosul, the country's largest city, is declared liberated by Mr. Abadi. The more than nine-month battle triggers an epic humanitarian crisis, as hundreds of thousands of residents are displaced.

Aug. 27: Tal Afar, the militants' last key Iraqi redoubt and a former transit point between Mosul and Raqqa, falls after just one week of fighting. Iraqi military officials cite for the swift victory factors including Islamic State's depleted resources.
