Back Story

“reed is good.”oday is the 30th anniversary of the release of the movie “all Street.”

Michael Douglas won an Oscar for his role as Gordon Gekko, the ruthless corporate raider who takes a young stockbroker named Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, under his wing.

The movie was meant as a harsh critique of the excesses of 1980s capitalism —ut became wildly popular with actual Wall Street types. (When it came out, our critic suggested that its moralizing was its weak point: “he movie crashes in a heap of platitudes,”incent Canby wrote.)

The director, Oliver Stone, said that in a twist, many young people told him it inspired them to go work on Wall Street. Even years later, brokers would tell him, “ou’e the man!”

Mr. Stone discussed the film’ legacy in this 2009 Times video. He said it was “isunderstood by some, because it was about a horrible thing that was going on, about how people would worship money at all costs.”

That interview took place as he was preparing to film the sequel, “all Street: Money Never Sleeps,”eleased in 2010. Our critic called it “ corrective, a parody and a sly act of auto-homage.”

Karen Zraick contributed reporting.
