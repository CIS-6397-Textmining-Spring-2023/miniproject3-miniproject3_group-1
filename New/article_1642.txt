WASHINGTONâ€”n associate of Islamic State's leader who U.S. officials said was behind a terror attack in Istanbul on New Year's Eve was killed by U.S. forces in Syria in early April, the U.S. Defense Department said Friday.             

Abdurakhmon Uzbeki was killed during a U.S. ground operation on April 6 in which he was the target, officials said. Mr. Uzbeki was considered an associate of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and aided in the plotting of the attack on an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, said Col. John Thomas, spokesman for U.S. Central Command.             

"Uzbeki facilitated the movement of ISIS foreign terror fighters and funds and he also played a key role in ISIS external terror-attack plotting," Col. Thomas said. "We have clearly linked him with the Istanbul New Year's bombing."             

The Pentagon didn't provide further details on the nature of the ground operation. Col. Thomas declined to further comment on the precise relationship between Mr. Uzbeki and Mr. Baghdadi, or the slain militant's position in the extremist group's hierarchy.                           

In the New Year's Eve attack, a gunman opened fire at the nightclub, killing dozens. The alleged shooter, Uzbek citizen Abdulgadir Masharipov, was arrested in January by Turkish authorities, who haven't concluded that he was acting on behalf of Islamic State, even though the group claimed responsibility for the attack.
