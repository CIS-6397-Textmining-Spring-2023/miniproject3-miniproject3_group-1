Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. President Trump said he would oppose reducing the amount that Americans can save in 401(k) retirement accounts, effectively killing with a tweet a plan that Republicans were considering to help pay for a $1.5 trillion tax cut.

The controversial idea: cap worker contributions at $2,400 annually for 401(k) accounts, far less than the current cap of $18,000 a year —r up to $24,000 for those over 50.

Mr. Trump also met with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore at the White House, above, for the signing of a $13.8 billion deal between Boeing and Singapore Airlines.

2. Myeshia Johnson, whose husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, was killed in Niger this month, said President Trump had blundered through his condolence call to her last week.

Ms. Johnson, above at Sergeant Johnson’ funeral on Saturday, said in a televised interview that Mr. Trump did not even seem to know her husband’ name. “t made me cry because I was very angry at the tone in his voice and how he said it,”he said.

Mr. Trump responded on Twitter that he “poke his name from beginning, without hesitation!”

_____

3. The D.E.A. has long maintained that the deaths of four civilians in an agency drug raid in Honduras in 2012 had come in “n exchange of gunfire.”

Through a Freedom of Information Act request, we obtained the video above, which shows otherwise. The grainy footage shows a canoe and a party boat colliding on a river in a remote part of the country —nd no sign of gunfire from the party boat.

“e still don’ know why this happened,”aid one woman who was aboard.

_____

4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a secret two-hour visit to the main American air base in Afghanistan to meet top Afghan officials, including President Ashraf Ghani, above.

That top American officials must sneak into the country after 16 years of war is testimony to the U.S. stalemate with the Taliban. We also looked at the C.I.A.’ expanding role in the fight against them.

Mr. Tillerson later flew to Baghdad for a meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.

_____

5. The Philippines declared victory after months of warfare against Islamic State-inspired militants in the city of Marawi.

But the group still has a presence nearby, and some locals say it’ only a matter of time before its flag flies again. Some Muslim separatists that have battled militias and government forces for years have allied with the army to fight ISIS.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is also in the Philippines this week for meetings with military officials from around the region.

_____

6. On her new NBC morning show, Megyn Kelly attacked Bill O’eilly and their mutual former employer, Fox News, following our report over the weekend that Mr. O’eilly paid a former Fox News legal analyst $32 million to settle sexual harassment allegations.

“hat on earth would justify that amount?”he asked. “hat awfulness went on?”

A Times interview with Mr. O’eilly about the claims got heated. Our podcast has the audio.

Separately, New York’ attorney general is investigating the Weinstein Company for civil rights violations.

_____

7. Nearly 400 mysterious stone structures have been discovered in the Saudi Arabian desert using Google Earth. Archaeologists believe they were built thousands of years ago by ancestors of modern-day Bedouins on lava fields, known as harrat.

“lying like a bird all over the Harrat from one enigmatic structure to another! How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?”aid an amateur archaeologist.

_____

8. It was a startling experimental procedure: Doctors lifted a woman’ uterus above her body to operate on her fetus.

We witnessed it at Texas Children’ Hospital. The 24-week-old fetus had severe spina bifida, a disabling spine defect that the surgery, performed with tiny instruments through slits in the uterus, can mitigate.

The mother, Lexi Royer, and her high-school sweetheart and now husband, Joshuwa, had always wanted children. Her due date is Jan. 14.

_____

9. In other news about innovations, New York City will phase out MetroCards by 2023, 30 years after they replaced tokens. Customers will pay by waving or swiping cellphones and credit or debit cards at the turnstile.

The announcement comes in a disastrous year for the subway system. The trains are such a mess —lagued with delays, malfunctions and even a derailment —hat the governor declared a state of emergency.

_____

10. Finally, for a while this past week, it looked as if we would have a 12th Dodger-Yankee World Series.

That touched off flashbacks for a generation of Brooklyn Dodgers fans, including our sportswriter George Vecsey, who “uffered terribly from 1947 through 1956,”hen the Dodgers were drubbed by the Yankees five times. Above, Jackie Robinson raced toward home plate in the opening game of the 1955 World Series.

Of course, this is 2017, and now the Los Angeles Dodgers will face the Houston Astros, starting tomorrow night.

“ like the way these Astros play. I like it when different teams win the Series,”r. Vecsey writes. “ut if Curtis Granderson gets his chance —earing Carl Furillo’ No. 6 —ell, that might be different.”

Have a great night.
