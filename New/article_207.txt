Back Story

Sixty years ago this week, the first animal was launched into orbit: Laika, a stray dog found on the streets of Moscow.

On Nov. 3, 1957, Soviet scientists covered Laika in a special spacesuit, placed her in the Sputnik 2 satellite and launched her toward the heavens.

“he barked greetings to her audience into the microphone,”according to a Times report at the time citing Soviet media.

Laika, of course, did not return. Questions about her fate were only resolved in 2002, when it was revealed that she died only hours after launch.

In 1960, another Soviet mission sent canine cosmonauts to space. This time, they returned to Earth safely after orbiting the planet.

The dogs, Belka and Strelka, traveled in separate compartments, connected by a window. Rats, mice and flies were also on their flight.

In 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy, the U.S. first lady, asked the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev about the two dogs, and he ordered one of Strelka’ puppies to be sent to White House as a gift.

One of President Kennedy’ other dogs, a Welsh terrier, soon bonded with the Soviet puppy, and they had four puppies of their own, which Kennedy called “upniks.”

Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.
