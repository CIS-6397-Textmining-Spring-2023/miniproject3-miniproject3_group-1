WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's new strategy to accelerate the fight against Islamic State will, at least initially, tweak and add a little more muscle to the existing plan, U.S. officials said.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to provide to Mr. Trump a series of recommendations for that plan in the coming days. Mr. Trump on Jan. 28 signed an order directing his Pentagon chief to come up with a preliminary draft of the plan within 30 days.

Mr. Trump will consider a range of options that are expected to include sending additional troops to Syria and to Iraq, at least in limited numbers, according to U.S. officials.

Two other possible steps could involve loosening battlefield restrictions, the officials said. One such step would give commanders more decision-making power on the use of U.S. forces in the field. A second would ease rules designed to minimize civilian casualties, according to U.S. officials. Loosening the civilian casualty rules would have the effect of increasing the number and rate of operations against Islamic State, officials said.

"What we're trying to do . . . is to outline the options that exist for dealing with the ISIS threat . . . but also to clearly outline for him . . . the risks associated with each one," said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joe Dunford, at a think-tank event in Washington. He declined to answer questions about the changes.

There is little indication that Mr. Trump's ultimate decision will fundamentally shake up the existing approach, U.S. officials and analysts said.
