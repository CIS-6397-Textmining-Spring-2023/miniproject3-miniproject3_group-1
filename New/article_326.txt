Good evening. Here’ the latest.

1. “he choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world. And we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.”

That was Mayor Bill de Blasio on the attempted terrorist attack in New York City. The crudely made pipe bomb that exploded in a crowded subway corridor during the morning rush injured a handful of people, sent commuters fleeing into the streets and disrupted the day for tens of thousands more. The explosion was caught on surveillance video.

Officials rapidly identified the suspect as Akayed Ullah, a 27-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh living in Brooklyn. He told officials he was inspired by ISIS. He is in custody and has been hospitalized for burns.

2. President Trump pushed back against an article that we published over the weekend, headlined “Inside Trump’ Hour-by-Hour Battle for Self-Preservation.”t was based on interviews with 60 advisers, associates, friends and members of Congress.

In particular, Mr. Trump insisted via Twitterthat he does not watch four to eight hours of television each day. “e stand by our reporting,” Times spokeswoman responded.

And the Treasury Department released an analysis of the Senate tax bill that suggested the $1.5 trillion plan would more than pay for itself —ut only if the economy grows much faster than any independent analysis has projected.

3. Alabama voters go to the polls tomorrow in what has become a national nail-biter: the special election for the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Roy Moore, the arch-conservative Republican dogged by accusations that he made sexual advances on underage girls, is holding a rally with Stephen Bannon tonight. Doug Jones, his Democratic challenger, is getting a big assist from Democratic and liberal groups across the country.

We discussed the race with our political correspondent Jonathan Martin on “he Daily.”

4. President Vladimir Putin of Russia took a whirlwind diplomatic tour of Egypt, Syria and Turkey, amid anger over President Trump’ decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’ capital.

Above, Mr. Putin, in car, waved goodbye to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The trip showcased Mr. Putin’ role as a global statesman just as he embarks on a campaign for another presidential term, his fifth and possibly last.

5. When the Islamic State seized territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014, it had the time and space to manufacture weapons on an industrial scale. We obtained extensive documents that show how the group built up its output levels “nlike anything we’e ever seen”rom a nonstate force.

At times the weapons were exceptionally cruel —ooby-traps that blew up homes, heaters packed with explosives. Above, an area of Mosul recently recaptured from the group.

“hey’e spreading this knowledge all over the world,”aid an explosives expert. “t’ going to the Philippines, it’ in Africa.”e added, “his stuff’ going to continue to grow.”

6. After reports that North Korea is developing the ability to launch submarine-based missiles, the U.S., Japan and South Korea are conducting drills to track such weapons.

Fears of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula are mounting. In China, a leaked document circulating online shows that a county along the border with North Korea is constructing refugee camps that could hold thousands of people.

7. Mario Batali, the celebrity chef, apologized and stepped away from his food empire and ABC’ “he Chew” after four unnamed women accused him of sexual harassment.

He’ one of the country’ most high-profile chefs and restaurant owners, and also a best-selling cookbook author. The accusations were first reported by Eater, the food website.

Separately, The New Yorker fired its Washington correspondent, Ryan Lizza, after it said he had engaged in “mproper sexual conduct.”e denied the charge.

8. Firefighters in Southern California have been getting some of the fires in Los Angeles and San Diego under control. But the Thomas Fire is still threatening communities around Santa Barbara. Above, a scene in Carpinteria.

9. Talk about unintended consequences. Among the transformations Nafta brought to Mexico: a diet more like the U.S.’, complete with lots of junk food, soda, meat —nd an epidemic of diet-related illnesses. Above, a Sam’ Club in Chiapas.

The latest installment of our series “lanet Fat”racks how the 1994 deal opened the floodgates to imports of cheap corn, meat and processed foods.

“he only way that Mexico became a ‘irst world’ountry was in terms of diet,”aid a trade expert.

_____

10. Finally, the Golden Globes nominations are out, led by Guillermo del Toro’ fantasy “he Shape of Water,”ith seven. Octavia Spencer, second left, and Sally Hawkins, center, both earned nominations for their roles in the film.

Here are the top nominees and a look at the surprises and snubs (no best screenplay for “et Out” “onder Woman”hut out; three nods for “ll the Money in the World”—rom which Kevin Spacey was eradicated).

Have a great night.
