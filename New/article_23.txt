• week of threatening exchanges between the U.S. and North Korea left China and South Korea on the sidelines and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, effectively in his preferred position: dealing directly with the U.S. Above, Mr. Kim’ image on TV in Seoul on Friday.

Back Story

If you’e looking to point fingers for one of the more giddily narcissistic trends of our time, look to the world’ smallest continent.

When the Oxford Dictionaries crowned “elfie”ts Word of the Year (edging out “werk”) a few years ago, its editors noted that the first known use of the term could be traced back to a post on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation forum that came 15 years ago this month.

There, a tipsy university-aged man posted a photo of his mouth, asking for medical advice for his lip, which he’ split open at a party.

“ had a hole about 1 cm long right through my bottom lip,”rote “opey.”“nd sorry about the focus, it was a selfie.”

It was a very Australian turn of phrase.

A “arbecue”s a “arbie.”our work colleague, Mr. Fitzgerald, is more often than not “itzy”t the pub.

Anna Wierzbicka, a linguistics professor at the Australian National University, has described the country’ love affair with such foreshortenings as reflective of cherished ideals, like “ateship,”umor, informality, and a dislike for “ong words.”

Although, given that Hopey turned out to be a man named Nathan Hope, maybe a casual tone is more important than brevity.
