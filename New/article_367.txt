Lost in the Wreckage

We visited the locations of nearly 150 airstrikes across northern Iraq, seeking to determine which air force launched them and whom they killed. The American-led coalition now acknowledges that it was the ''probable'' source of many more of those strikes than previously disclosed. Here are the stories of some of the victims.

A.K. and A.G.

HOME OF MOHAMMED TAYEB AL-LAYLA

Dhubat, eastern Mosul

Stated target ''Known ISIS weapons cache''

3 CIVILIAN DEATHS

Date Jan. 10, 2017

Ahmed al-Layla tried to persuade his parents to escape from Mosul with his sister, Eaman, and join him in Erbil, but they were stubborn. His father, Mohammed Tayeb al-Layla (below left), a former dean of engineering at Mosul University, refused to abandon his prized library, shelf after shelf of books on engineering and soil mechanics. As the Iraqi Army approached, neighbors told us, several ISIS fighters broke into the home, climbed to the roof and assumed sniper positions. Ahmed's father raced up in pursuit, with Ahmed's mother, Dr. Fatima Habbal (below right), a prominent gynecologist, close behind. Not long after, an airstrike flattened the home, killing the snipers, along with Ahmed's parents and sister.

HOME OF Salam al-Odeh

Downtown Qaiyara

Stated target''Known ISIS weapons cache''

7 CIVILIAN DEATHS

Date March 19, 2016

When ISIS left a mortar in Qaiyara's rail yard, a local informant passed on the coordinates for an airstrike. The strikes hit the rail yard (above), but ISIS had moved on. Instead, the homes of Salam al-Odeh and Aaz-Aldin Muhammad Alwan were hit. Salam's wife, Harbia, hung on until she reached the hospital, where she told her relatives what happened, then died of her injuries. A few weeks later, her son Musab died of his wounds, too. Of the eight people living in the two homes struck, only Rawa (below), who was 2, survived.

HOME OF RAFI AL-IRAQI

Al-Zirai, eastern Mosul

Stated target''Known ISIS HQ facility''

16 CIVILIAN DEATHS

Date Jan. 6, 2017

In early 2016, an ISIS patrol forced its way into the home of Rafi al-Iraqi (below, with his children), demanding the family's cellphones. Sama (right), Rafi's 10-year-old daughter, burst into tears and produced her mother's phone, which contained negative messages about ISIS that she had recently sent to her sister in Erbil. Rafi and his wife were arrested and interrogated, but only he was released. When Rafi asked about his wife, he was told, ''We'll bring her to you.'' Not long after, the family received her bullet-riddled body. Almost precisely a year later, at the height of the Mosul offensive, an airstrike leveled Rafi's house and two others next door. Only Rafi, his mother and his 12-year-old son, Mohammed (far left), survived.
