AUSTRALIA

ISIS Claims Attack

In Melbourne Suburb

Authorities said they are treating a deadly siege in a Melbourne suburb as an act of terrorism, though they haven't found direct links between the perpetrator and Islamic State, which claimed responsibility.

The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Yacqub Khayre, killed a man and held a woman hostage in an apartment building Monday before he was shot and killed by police. The woman wasn't hurt.

Police said the gunman, an Australian citizen originally from Somalia, was on parole after serving seven years in prison for reckless intent to cause harm.

INDIA

Launch of Rocket

Deemed Successful

India successfully launched its heaviest-yet rocket, which it hopes will eventually be able to carry astronauts into space, a feat that only Russia, the U.S. and China have achieved, its space agency said.

The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III rocket lifted off from Sriharikota, an island off the coast of Andhra Pradesh state, and placed a communication satellite into orbit, the Indian Space Research Organization said. In the past, India has used French rockets to launch its heavier communication satellites.
