Back Story

“hen something outrages you,”e wrote, “s Nazism did me, that is when you become a militant, strong and engaged.”

Born on this day in 1917, Stéhane Hessel, a French Resistance hero and Holocaust survivor, became an unlikely publishing phenomenon in 2011 at the age of 93, topping best-seller lists with “ndignez-Vous!”

At only about 4,000 words, “ndignez-Vous!”“ime for Outrage!” was more of a pamphlet. But it resonated with French readers who were gearing up for a presidential election, and those abroad who were protesting the eurozone crisis, participating in the Arab Spring uprisings and occupying Wall Street.

Mr. Hessel, above, urged young people to revive the spirit of the resistance by peacefully protesting the financial markets, France’ treatment of illegal immigrants, the influence of the rich on the news media and Israel’ treatment of Palestinians.

“ndignez-Vous!”old more than three million copies in Europe in less than a year and was translated into more than a dozen languages. (The Nation magazine published the full text in English.)

Mr. Hessel died in 2013, but his call to outrage endures: “ou join the movement of history,”e wrote, “nd the great current of history continues to flow only thanks to each and every one of us.”
