Please note: Before addressing this event in the classroom, you might read our advice on talking about sensitive issues in the news.

Because The Learning Network is for students 13 and older, our resources focus on understanding the Las Vegas massacre and its implications, but parents and teachers of younger students might find this advice, published by The Times after the Newtown shootings, more helpful. Our friends at Scholastic also offer these Resources for Responding to Violence and Tragedy.

You may also consult our resources for teaching and learning about the attacks on Orlando and Newtown.

We will continue to update this post.

The Shooter

What is known about Stephen Paddock, the alleged shooter? What is not yet known?

Following the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo. in 2012, Dave Cullen wrote in an Opinion piece:

Perpetrators of mass murder are usually nothing like our conceptions of them. They are nothing like a vision of pure evil. They are complicated.

Do you agree with this assessment? What is “omplicated”bout Mr. Paddock?

_________

Understanding the Logistics

In the days since the Las Vegas shooting, the Times has compiled data on the weapons used by Mr. Paddock, his preparations and the scene of the massacre. Explore these graphics, videos and audio clips. What sets this shooting apart from other mass shootings in the United States? What factors came together to make this one especially lethal? What questions still remain about what happened that night?

_________

President Trump Responds

Watch or read President Trump’ statement in response to the Las Vegas shooting. What is your reaction to his remarks? What words or phrases stand out to you most, and why?

How, in your view, should our political leaders respond in the wake of violence like this? Why?

_________

Performers Speak Out

[Video: Jimmy Kimmel on Mass Shooting in Las Vegas Watch on YouTube.]

On Oct. 2, many Late Night television hosts dedicated a portion of their show to addressing the Las Vegas shooting. What is your reaction to the segments? Which one resonates with you the most, and why? In your opinion, did these hosts address the event appropriately? If so, what did they say (or not say) that makes you think so? If not, why not?

Read the responses from Jason Aldean and other performers at the country music festival. What feelings and thoughts come up for you as you learn more about the attack?

_________

Celebrating Ordinary Heroes

In times of tragedy, ordinary people often act heroically. During the shooting, people protected loved ones and strangers from bullets and helped them get to safety. In the hours following the attack, nurses, doctors, fire personnel, hospital administrators and volunteers rushed to Las Vegas’ only trauma center to care for hundreds of victims, and lines formed at daybreak outside of blood banks.

In this Op-Ed, one Las Vegas resident writes about Las Vegas hospitality workers taking care of people. What heroes or heroic acts have you read about? What are some things you can do to help in your own way?

_________

Remembering the Victims

One way to respond to a tragedy such as this is by remembering the victims. Read the stories of the people who lost their lives in the Las Vegas attack. How can the victims’ives be recognized, honored, and celebrated?

Consider creating a collage or bulletin board profiling them, like The Lives They Lived or Portraits of Grief series featured in the Times following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Brainstorm ways you may be able to offer condolences to the families or do a related service learning project that grows out of your thoughts and feelings about this event and the victims’ives.

_________

A History of Mass Shootings

The Times has a timeline of mass shootings in the United States that begins with the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007, though this is just a partial list. Records indicate that on average, a mass shooting takes place every day in the country, though most do not make national headlines.

How does this most recent shooting compare to others? Which of the ones highlighted in this timeline do you remember? What do you notice and what do you wonder as you scroll through this list?

_________

The Gun Control Debate

Events like this inevitably lead to debates about gun laws and gun control. Study this graphic of mass shootings in the United States. What statement do you think it is trying to make? What feelings and thoughts does it bring up for you?

Where do you stand in the gun control debate? Some Times Op-Ed columnists and contributors, including Nicholas Kristof, Robert J. Spitzer and Roxanne Gay, believe that the United States needs stricter gun control laws, while conservative writer Ross Douthat argues that tighter gun regulations might not necessarily be the solution to preventing mass shootings. With whom do you most agree? What challenges prevent gun control legislation from being passed?

What do you think the United States should do to prevent future mass shootings? Read how other students responded to that question after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and add your voice to the conversation by commenting here.

Or, read last fall’ Civil Conversation Challenge on guns, in which we invited teenagers to talk about the issues that divided Americans during the 2016 election. More than 700 responses came in to the questions we posed about gun rights, the Second Amendment and more.

_________

The N.R.A. and Gun Violence in America

The National Rifle Association (N.R.A.) is an American non-profit organization that advocates for gun rights. Listen to The Daily: The Power of the N.R.A. to understand the organization’ connection to the gun control debate in the United States.

How did the N.R.A. become the powerful lobbying group it is today? What does the speaker argue is the relationship between the N.R.A. and gun violence in America? What is your opinion on the N.R.A.’ role in U.S. politics?

_________

How Does the U.S. Compare to the Rest of the World?

Look at the graph above. What does it tell you about gun-related deaths in the United States compared to the rest of the world? What are some possible explanations for the graph? Read the related article or watch this video to learn more about why some argue that gun violence is a uniquely American problem.

_________

Domestic Terrorism

In “Terrorizing if Not Clearly Terrorist: What to Call the Las Vegas Attack?” Scott Shane notes that President Trump did not call the shooting “errorism” Why not? When is a violent act considered “errorism” How does labeling something as “errorism”hange the way we respond to it?

Read Op-Ed columnist Thomas L. Friedman’ thoughts about why Stephen Paddock was not labeled a terrorist. They begin this way:

If only Stephen Paddock had been a Muslim …f only he had shouted “llahu akbar”efore he opened fire on all those concertgoers in Las Vegas …f only he had been a member of ISIS …f only we had a picture of him posing with a Quran in one hand and his semiautomatic rifle in another …

If all of that had happened, no one would be telling us not to dishonor the victims and “oliticize”addock’ mass murder by talking about preventive remedies.

No, no, no. Then we know what we’ be doing. We’ be scheduling immediate hearings in Congress about the worst domestic terrorism event since 9/11.

Do you agree with him? Why or why not?

_________

Fake News

As we remind you often on this site, as news breaks and emotions are high, it is especially important to verify what you read before spreading it on social media. The Times has compiled a list of misinformation that has spread about the Las Vegas shooting. As you scroll through, ask yourself: Would I have “iked”r shared any of these if they came across my newsfeed? If so, look at them closely. What questions might you have asked, or what steps could you have taken, to verify if they were true before you shared them?

Read about the role Google and Facebook played in spreading false information about the Las Vegas shooter and the challenges they face in trying to quell it. Do you think these platforms have a responsibility to stop fake news from spreading? What could be the consequences if they do? What could be the consequences if they don’?
